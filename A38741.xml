            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere was once but one uniform, ſimple and genuine Reaſon, the ſure Guide, and uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Rule of all humane Counſels, until the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of <hi>Mans</hi> Nature, by its Luciferian Arrogance, would needs exalt Senſe above her, and <hi>ſought out many devices</hi> to accompliſh it. One of the chief
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47448:7"/>Projections hereto was the deriving and ſlucing out that comprehenſive and capacious receptacle, the <hi>conſervation of the publick good,</hi> lodged in the depths of wiſdom, into manifold branches, and oblique narrow windings and Maeanders of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate advantages, which ſo drained and exhauſted that firſt Bed and copious ſource of all thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which the firſt Age of the World enjoyed, that it is now become a meer ſhallow conception, and like the Springs of the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> more in Notion and Speculation, than of any certain Exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>And this hath been the labour and induſtry of all Perſons in all ages, the Populacy, and the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar as guilty of the Innovation as thoſe Potentates whom they implead of a moſt injurious Uſurpation of their right: all times concurring in their ſuffrage againſt this firſt Law, ſeeking nothing elſe in the changes and viciſſitudes of ſo many Governments, but their temporary eaſe, and ſome particular Emoluments to themſelves, although they have vainly pretended, that thoſe their reſtleſs Agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and irregular confuſed wayes to the pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the publique, were nothing elſe but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural tendencies, how violent ſoever to that common Center, the <hi>Good</hi> of the <hi>Whole.</hi>

               <note place="margin">That Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Common Good how iluded.</note>By which means it hath come to paſs, that the World hath put on another dreſs, and hath been diſguiſed in various ſhapes of Policies, ſuch as would beſt ſute the Humour and Genius of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, without conſulting that firſt and perpetual Principle, which in this crazy declenſion of all things, muſt needs be ſuppoſed to abate and loſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47448:7"/>of its vigour; And to help out this Poſition, Men have invented an Artifice, by placing ſuch and ſuch Nations under ſuch &amp; ſuch Climes &amp; Temperatures, which either do ſo rarefact and attenuate it in ſome ſharper and ſerener Aires of <hi>Europe,</hi> that it is as good as loſt, or elſe condenſate it in ſome thicker and groſſer Regions, that it is as difficult to be found.</p>
            <p>And under theſe, or the like Capricies, are the <hi>Europeans</hi> rendred obnoxious to one another, by natural Antipathies framed to keep them in mutual abhorrence, (as if wiſe Nature, when ſhe framed but one Man in the beginning, out of whoſe Loyns all Nations ſhould proceed, had compoſed him to their very purpoſe of inconſiſtent and unſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable Qualities and Materials) which hath been fomented alſo by two of the moſt powerful Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Jealouſie and Ambition, the Effects where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in ſundry National Quarrells, have almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed both the Combatants. But Jealouſie is the uncurable Diſeaſe, which hath made <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endom</hi> to languiſh under a tedious and waſting Conſumption, in ſpite of all cure and remedy, even of the peaceful and ſaving Goſpel, by the ineffectual operation whereof, we are not only like to become a Prey, but are already the ſcorn and reproach of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Infidels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Me thinks I hear that of <hi>Lucan,</hi> in his elegant flattery to <hi>Nero,</hi> given as true counſel and advice in the Courts of ſome Princes and States,</p>

            <p>To get ſo high, that they may govern and ballance the World, and overlook the Affairs of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; which Elevation to ſo tickliſh a point of Grandeur and Felicity, as it hath been fancied by ſome, is ſo incapable of perſiſtency, that the Fate of <hi>Phaeton</hi> hath attended their ambitious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and caſt their Dominions into Flame and Combuſtion.</p>
            <p>Not to deny, but that a juſt Temperature of a formidable power and greatneſs, ought to be nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regarded, when the vicinity of ſo many united Dominions and Soveraignties unequally diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, may give ſuſpicion of Encroachment; but when ſuch Diſcourſes are like the ſtory of 88. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquated, and very unpracticable; and the very Umbrages of thoſe things diſappear, and are vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, for that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy, and the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> (whoſe great acceſſions of Territory gave riſe to thoſe Obſervations on which the Policy of the laſt Age was founded) are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to be conſumptive, and to ſtand meerly on the defenſive part; the preſent diviſions of <hi>Europe</hi> in this unhappy Juncture cannot be palliated or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with this fig-leaf.</p>
            <p>As, if the Toſs of Ambition be in the other Bucket, which in counterpoize of the formers aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring glories, hath ſtrugled through a War of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a 100. years duration, but hath now inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed Aimes and Deſignes by Converſion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the ſelf-ſame advantages of a Purſe and Puiſſance; the ſaid Differences are more enviouſly calamitous, and are ſo far from Colour of Excuſe, that they give the World to ſee, that they do not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47448:8"/>act by the Rule of what they ought, but what they may or can do; and that the longeſt Sword hath no meaſure but its Scabbard, to which once drawn, it ſeldom returns. Such as theſe may be the occult cauſe of our Differences, (not imputing it to the preſent War between the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> and the <hi>Pole,</hi> which is an Haereditary and National Quarrell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Lands of their Dominions, conterminate and confining upon one another; or to ſome ſmall miſ-underſtandings in <hi>Germany,</hi> not conſiderable but for this Juncture, of both which we ſhall treat in its place more amply) but there is a kind of Evil, which hath attended every grand and happy Revolution in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> that is aſſignable as the principal and general Motion to theſe preſent Troubles.</p>
            <p>Fortune was never yet ſo reſpectful and offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly kind, but that her Train was very chargeable; nor doth ſhe in her greateſt Indulgence but fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and commute her Favours. The late ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Peace was not given <hi>Gratis,</hi> nor thoſe <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladian</hi> Semblances of Accommodation, without armed force in the womb of thoſe concealed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes which yet amuſe <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> and it is moſt true, that the Pope his Holineſs, who, in the beginning of his Papacy, laid about him ſo much for the Reconciliation of the two Crowns, was not over-pleaſed when he ſaw it was finiſhed, and yet not out of any pique with the Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> (who attributed to himſelf the glory of the Affair, by timing it to his own Notes) as hath been ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but becauſe he prudently foreſaw that the over-grown power of that King would be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47448:9"/>to the Eccleſiaſtical State.</p>
            <p>So that Peace and War are like Generation and Corruption, they follow one another, naturally and commonly the greater the pacification is, and the more things ſeem to be ſtilled and compoſed, the more vehement and violent the rupture; for War is like an Earthquake, preſaged by a ſerene Sky, and a quiet, gentle Air, ſooner than by any other prognoſtick or ſign whatſoever. And ſo much leſs ſufficient is the ſtate of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> to provide againſt the ſuddenneſs of ſuch a calamity, for that the ſcale of Politiques, as was hinted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is quite altered, and of a different and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous adminiſtration, the power being circulated to another Corner, and with the Wind may blow where it liſt, while the Eaſtern Torrent or Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion carries all before it.</p>
            <p>Having thus glanced at theſe Cauſes which have embroyled <hi>Europe,</hi> we come now to the Effects in the deſcription and account thereof for the plain and perfect Elucidation of the premiſes; and firſt we conſider <hi>Europe</hi> in General, where we content our ſelves with the ſurvey of its Extent and Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Pole</hi> is otherwiſe at perfect Peace with all his Neighbours, having the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> very various of adhaerence, to his aſſiſtance in this War; and he is pretty well aſſured at home, the Nobility having ſo ſorely ſmarted for their Pride, and Diſſentions, by the <hi>Swede;</hi> and the late Army of the Confaederates, notwithſtanding the Grudges thereof, are wholly disbanded; but this courſe is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to vent the Humour abroad.

               <p>The Intereſt of this Kingdom requires, that a good Underſtanding and Correſpondence be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained betwixt the King and the Nobility; not to quarrel with the <hi>Turk;</hi> to preſerve Friendſhip with the <hi>Swede;</hi> to make Alliance with the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> and to keep the <hi>Tartars</hi> at home; to ruine the <hi>Muſcovite;</hi> to have an eye upon the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> and to reſpect <hi>France,</hi> as that which can put a ſtop to the Imperial Armes, if they ſhould enterprize upon that Kingdom.</p>

Oftentimes Travellers are brought dead and ſtiffe in their Sledges to Towns, without any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivance of it while touched; ſo ſudden and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing is the outrage of that Climate.

They are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very theeviſh, and moſt cunning Knaves in their bargains, and impudent withall, to out-face any thing. They are ſpunged and fleeced by their Superiours, and therefore right or wrong they will make themſelves whole. They are generally gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to drink, from which the Prieſts do not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain; and covet Tobacco, ſeverely forbidden them, with which they will make themſelves moſt abhominably drunk. In all the Oppreſſion they ſuffer, they think rather better than worſe of their Prince, and begin to reckon their Sins, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly lament for having offended him. None of them ever ſtirrs out of the Country, unleſs with Ambaſſadours: nor Stranger neither, if once in, if he articled not for his liberty of return, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Merchants; who having formerly traded by the <hi>Baltique</hi> Sea to the <hi>Narve,</hi> now ſayl about the Northern Cape, in the great Ocean, to the <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> Bay, and ſo to the Port of St. <hi>Archangel,</hi> near the mouth of the River <hi>Duina.</hi> The other chief Cities of Trade are <hi>Volegda, Muſco.</hi> The Imperial Reſidence <hi>Novogorod, Smolensko,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>The Government is meerly Tyrannical and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary, and comes neareſt to that of the <hi>Turks,</hi> as one of the <hi>Viziers</hi> reſembled them: For he is ſole Executor to the Eſtates of deceaſed Perſons, and ſometimes too to thoſe that are living; for if he ſends for a Summ of Money to ſuch a Perſon, of whoſe Wealth he hath information, it is preſently ſent him, without the leaſt grumbling: and if he ſends for his Head, it is ſent him, with the ſame diſpatch: And this may be, and is the Caſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo of the greateſt Nobleman in the Empire; more frequently uſed to very great Barbarities in the Reign of that monſtrous Tyrant <hi>Vaſilowich.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since whoſe death, by reaſon of two preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Impoſtors, who uſurped the Throne: and the Faction of the Grandees, who advanced o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; the Nobility have had the Liberty of Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Prince: And yet ſuch is their natural Fondneſs of Slavery, that they advanced their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Subjects to the ſame unbounded Soveraignty. No Prince can be ſerved in greater State: He ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſheweth himſelf unto the People, but in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel of ineſtimable value, all gliſtering with Jewells; and in his Court, at any ſolemn Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of Ambaſſadors, the great Audience Chamber is furniſhed with all ſorts of Plate of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite value, and filled with men in Veſts of Cloth of Gold, which are ordinarily ſome grave well-Countenanced
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47448:23"/>Citizens, who for this purpoſe are apparelled out of his Wardrobe; a moſt glorious Cheat to ſuch as know not the myſtery of this Pomp and Magnificence.</p>
               <p>His Revenues, by what hath been ſaid, may be what he pleaſeth himſelf; but theſe two laſt Princes have uſed a very moderate hand toward their Slaves, as they ſtyle themſelves. His ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry means and way of amaſſing Treaſure is, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſing or foreſtalling moſt of the homebred Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, (beſides, all the Drink that is drawn in the Empire, is Farmed to his uſe; and a monthly account taken of the Cabacks or Victualing Houſes, how much is ſpent, which muſt be preſently ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to his Officers) and hindring all Trade till his own be ſold, is a moſt vaſt and therefore uncertain Revenue. 2. By his Proviſion and Purveyance of Rent, Corn and Victual, raiſed ſome years to 200000. Rubbles, which Coyn makes little more than an Angel. 3. The Poll Money to 200. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pound Sterling. 4. His Cuſtoms, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe chiefly and ſolely from his Ports of <hi>Archangel</hi> and <hi>Aſtracan,</hi> to 400000 <hi>l.</hi> 5. By his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, Eſcheats, and Forfeitures, and Preſents: (very conſiderable on this account) All which may make up two Millions of Pounds Sterling, or two and a half at moſt; which were no great Sum, were he to pay for the ſervice of all his Horſemen, who, like the <hi>Turks</hi> Timariots, have Farmes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them.</p>
               <p>As to his Forces, and the Militia of this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, they are of a very formidable and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Power: For firſt, He hath of his Dworancy,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47448:24"/>or the Guard of his Perſon, 25000. Horſemen, who are alwayes in readineſs where ever he reſides. Then there are Lands let out to ſeveral of his great Men, which are never aliened from that uſe, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the preſent Proprietors changed at his pleaſure; for the Profits whereof, they are bound to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain 65000. Horſe more; and theſe likewiſe are alwayes to be ready at ſound of Trumpet; which makes a ſtanding Body of 90000. which with Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and other Voluntiers, are effectually in the Field a hundred thouſand.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe, He may raiſe what additional Numbers the Country will afford; whish is ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful of Horſe, that it is ſaid, he is able to bring 300000. into the Campania: but it is of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide ſuppoſed, he cannot find ſo many Riders by one half; eſpecially conſidering, that at the ſame time as theſe Horſe are in ſervice, his Foot hardly exceed the number of 40000. not only, for that he confides not in his Infantry, as unapt to the War: but becauſe of the thinneſs of his Countries. Of late years he hath found out a way to ſupply that defect, by entertaining foreign Foot, chiefly <hi>Germans,</hi> and once ſome <hi>Engliſh,</hi> about the year 1633. in a Regiment tranſported by Collonel <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> amounting to near 3000. Men; at which time he beſieged <hi>Smolensko,</hi> (once a Province, under the protection of the <hi>Pole;</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Southweſt 80. <hi>Polonian</hi> Miles from <hi>Moſco;</hi> taken by <hi>Vaſilowich,</hi> and retaken by the <hi>Poles</hi> in 1610. with the loſs of 200000. <hi>Muſcovites</hi>) two years together; at laſt came the <hi>Pole,</hi> when the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> was wearied out, and beſieged the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47448:24"/>and reduced them by Famine to a ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: For which the General loſt his Head at <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> although Coſen of the Emperour; and his Son was whipp'd to death, as was the Major General; the Lieutenant General eſcaped at the interceſſion of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who had done excellent ſervice, (and had taught the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> how to ſtand a Shock of the <hi>Poles</hi> Lances, and to break their Troops) and could give a handſome Character of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as to his part; ever ſince which time the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Officers have been highly reſpected and preferred.</p>
               <p>This Emperour therefore is better provided of Foot than any of his Predeceſſors, who could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make 20000. and therefore loſt that they had gained, becauſe they wanted thoſe ſtanding De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences to make good their ground; having trained up a number of his own Subjects to the Diſcipline, and by the example of Strangers; ſo that he is able to bring near 50000. into the Field, if neceſſity require.</p>
               <p>He is excellently and infinitely ſtored, as much as any Prince in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> with all manner of Artillery great and ſmall, with Ammunition and Proviſion ſutable. His Souldiers moſt patient of Cold and Hunger, and ſuſtained with little: but better to maintain a Fortreſs, than to aſſault it, or engage in Battel: Notwithſtanding, they will do what they are commanded, in the moſt preſent dangers, but it is not out of boldneſs or bravery of Spirit.</p>
               <p>They have been twice invaded with the <hi>Turks</hi> alone (not joyned with the <hi>Tartars</hi>) the firſt
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47448:25"/>time was in the Reign of <hi>Vaſilowich,</hi> in 1569. when <hi>Selymus</hi> the Second attempted to cut a Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable Trench betwixt the <hi>Tanais,</hi> and the River <hi>Volga;</hi> and brought his Fleet out of the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea: but the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> overthrew his Forces, and ſpoyled his Navy and Deſign together. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was in 1598. by 70000. of them, in the Winter time; 40000. of whom were preſently nummed and killed with the Cold, not knowing the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> preventing Chirugery; which is to rub their Noſe and Ears every foot with Ice or Snow, to recall the motive Spirits to thoſe parts, which otherwiſe they might loſe: the remainder ran home to catch themſelves a heat; ſince which time the <hi>Turk</hi> hath never troubled this Country: Nor doth the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> think it worth his pains to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade his Southward upon the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, being parted from all other his Territories by <hi>Poland, Moldavia,</hi> and <hi>Tranſylvania;</hi> ſo that without their leave, he can attempt nothing againſt him: and their leave he is never like to have, unleſs invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble neceſſity and calamity perſwade it.</p>
               <p>His continual Goads and Thorns are on the Weſt of his Dominions, the <hi>Pole,</hi> and the <hi>Swede;</hi> to whom he hath loſt more than he hath gained of the <hi>Tartar:</hi> Notwithſtanding, ſince the Empire hath been ſetled in this new Family, whereof there have been but two Princes in the tract of near 50. years; eſpecially in the Reign of this preſent Great Duke, they have not got much Ground: nay, the <hi>Pole</hi> hath loſt the Dutchy of <hi>Smolensko</hi> in 1654. with ſome other Places, which is the preſent Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel and Cauſe of this <hi>Poliſh</hi> Expedition.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:47448:25"/>
               <p>The Peace with the <hi>Swede,</hi> which the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> prefers, hath been long in agitation, by reaſon it is clogged with ſo many Demands, and nice Claims of both Parties; but it is believed, the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> muſt quit many of his Pretenſions and Punctilioes, leſt that Negotiation take no Effect, and the <hi>Swede</hi> take advantage. Little elſe can be ſaid of this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, as to his Intereſt in <hi>Europe,</hi> where he was never further concerned, than theſe two Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Lithuania</hi> and <hi>Livonia;</hi> and ſcarce known to our Parts, till almoſt 90. years ſince: They main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Correſpondence with Us in point of Commerce only, and with our Nation eſpecial Friendſhip and Affection, particularly towards the Soveraignes of <hi>England:</hi> Beſides, they are of very little or no Addreſs, there being not a Schollar a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, for even their Prieſts can but read.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, They never made any Alliance by Marriage with any Chriſtian or Neighbour Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but chuſe their Wives from among their own Subjects: nor do they marry their Princes Children to them; in this, like the <hi>Grand Seigniour,</hi> whoſe Policy they reſemble; and certainly this is ſome ſecret Principle of State; for it is not many years agoe, ſince <hi>Wolmar,</hi> the Brother to the preſent King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> came thither a Suitor to one of the Siſters of the Emperour, and was there nuzled with a fruitleſs Expectation of a Match, but in concluſion had much adoe to eſcape out of their Dominion. In ſum, They care not for, indeed ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor, the Introduction of new Cuſtomes, and to that purpoſe prohibit Communication with Strangers, as the only bane of their Government: nor muſt a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47448:26"/>Foreigner ſtir abroad without leave, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And laſtly, They are ſo Proudly conceited of their own Prudence, that they think their Politiques the moſt perfect and abſolute in the World.</p>
               <p>No queſtion he would lend his <hi>Hand</hi> againſt the <hi>Turk</hi> (if for no other Cauſe than the Vindication of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, of which he is the ſole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Protector) but it is not <hi>Long</hi> enough, and will not reach that diſtant Enemy, but by the wayes aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>The preſent Emperours Name is <hi>Alexei Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowich,</hi> that is, the Son of <hi>Michael,</hi> which is all the Sir-name they uſe, both Prince and People: His Fathers Chriſtian Name being <hi>Michael Fedorowitz,</hi> the Son of <hi>Theodore,</hi> who was Patriarch of <hi>Muſco.</hi> This <hi>Michael,</hi> the Nobles (having been twice impoſed on by the <hi>Polanders,</hi> who brought in two counterfeit Princes, named <hi>Demetrius,</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sons of <hi>Vaſilowich,</hi> the laſt Prince but one of the Royal Blood; and in their quarrel ſubdued <hi>Moſco,</hi> and almoſt ruined the Empire) weary of their own Confuſions, and the intollerable oppreſſion of the <hi>Poles,</hi> unanimouſly choſe for their Emperour; who ſetled the State, and managed it in a more conſtant way of Peace with the <hi>Turk, Tartar, Pole,</hi> and <hi>Swede,</hi> than any of his Predeceſſors had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. He began his Reign in 1615. and died in 1646. much lamented and adored of his Slaves, as well for his foreign Acts, as thoſe at home; and for his Juſtice and Moderation: And ſo we paſs Weſtward to the Kingdom of <hi>Sweden.</hi>

               <p>THis Kingdom is bounded on the Eaſt with <hi>Muſcovy;</hi> on the Weſt with great Hills, which divide it from <hi>Norway;</hi> on the North with the great Frozen Ocean; and on the South with <hi>Donmark, Livonia,</hi> and the <hi>Baltique</hi> Sea. For the quantity, reckoning in <hi>Lapland,</hi> it exceedeth <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> by 900. Miles: and for fertility, if you count Wells, Stones, Mountains, and Lakes; it excelleth them both likewiſe: but <hi>Goth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Finland</hi> are excellently well ſtored with all Neceſſaries, and ſupply their Neighbours with Malt and Barley.</p>
               <p>The Religion is <hi>Lutheran,</hi> introducted by <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtavus Ericus,</hi> or <hi>de Vaſa,</hi> deſcended from the laſt King <hi>Magnus,</hi> who coveted the Revenues of the Church, but kept up the Epiſcopal Dignity, who have Voices in Parliament. The <hi>Swediſh</hi> Gentleman is a well-accompliſh'd and gallant Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a good Souldier, and a good Captain, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands the Politiques, and ſpeaks moſt Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. They are ſomething fierce and inſolent on
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47448:27"/>advantage, but it is in War, which excuſeth it. The People are naturally ſtrong and active, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, patient and induſtrious; are very humble, and hoſpitable to Strangers; and in the Northern Parts ſo healthy, that they live commonly to the Age of 130. or 140. years; and this is imputed to the purity of the Air, but ſometimes over-caſt with Foggs, by reaſon the Inhabitants neglect the Water-courſes of their miry ſtanding Lakes. Of no great note for Arts or Armes, till that <hi>Guſtavus Ericus,</hi> who chaſed out the <hi>Danes,</hi> under their King <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> the 3d. and <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> whoſe Conqueſts were admirable, and his Conduct not to be matched by any Parallel: They are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding apt to learn the Mechanick Arts, ſo that every Souldier is his own Smith, Cutler, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are very Valiant, both their Horſe and Foot, as they have given good proof, both in <hi>Germany, Poland, Ruſſia,</hi> and <hi>Denmark.</hi> Their Religion is wholly <hi>Lutheran;</hi> Biſhops they have, whom they call Surintendents, and who retain their Voice in Parliaments, but have no ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Church Revenue, being paid and maintained by the King, with an inconſiderable yearly Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>The whole Kingdom is divided into two Parts, the one lying on the Eaſt, the other on the Weſt ſide of the Gulph or Bay of <hi>Bodner,</hi> or <hi>Sinus Bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicus,</hi> a ſpacious Branch of the <hi>Baltique</hi> Sea; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which diviſion there are, 1. the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Gottoland.</hi> 2. Of <hi>Sweden,</hi> lying on the Weſt ſide. And 3. <hi>Lapland,</hi> on the North. 4. <hi>Bodden.</hi> 5. <hi>Finland.</hi> And 6. the <hi>Swediſh Iſlands;</hi>

               </p>
               <p>As for the Government, it is Monarchical and Abſolute to the King <hi>in Actu,</hi> but the Senators pretend it to be Elective, although the Son hath continually ſucceeded his Father in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was made a Sanction by the States, at the inſtance of the ſame <hi>Ericus,</hi> who would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Crown, urged upon him, without ſuch a Law: and this hath prevailed ever ſince, but in the Caſe of <hi>Sigiſmond,</hi> beaten out of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> by the Faction of <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Suderman</hi> his Uncle: for we have ſeen the Infant Son of the late <hi>Charles Guſtavus</hi> advanced immediately upon his Fathers death to the Throne. And when the King is once ſeated there, he governs <hi>pro imperio,</hi> for he layes what Taxes he pleaſeth, as 5, 6, 7, 8, Dollars yearly upon every Houſholder, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his quality: And that which is chief, all Appeals for final Determination are made to him, not to his Parliament or Council.</p>
               <p>This Kings Revenue conſiſteth in four things, the Tenths of Eccleſiaſtical Livings, Mines, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, and Cuſtomes. 1. The Revenues of the Church ariſe to a great Summ, conſiſting before the Reformation of ſeven Biſhopricks, and ſixty Monaſteries, which enjoyed very great Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, now incorporated into the Crown, except only ſome ſmall maintenance to the Biſhops, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boveſaid.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47448:28"/>2. His Mines, a great deal more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, for that his tenth part of three Copper Works, almoſt a hundred years agoe, yielded him 3000. Dollars, whereby eſtimation may be made of his Silver and Gold. And thoſe Mines may be found in every place, if the Country Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (bound to carry wood, and do other ſervile work there) did not hide and hinder the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. Moſt fine Silver is found in the Province of <hi>Veſtras,</hi> were it not for the envy and jealouſie of the Inhabitants, either murmuring that Strangers ſhould be employed, or ſuſpecting that they ſhould be over-reached; ſo that his Revenue is mightily hindred by this means. 3. But his Taxes do far ſurpaſs all his other Incomes, for he levyeth the Tenth of Rye, Wheat, Barley, Fiſh, Skins, Oxen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of the Tenth of Oxen he hath ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered at ſome times 18000. Dollars, with all which he maintaineth his Court, Officers, Navy, and Armies. In the time of War with <hi>Dane</hi> or <hi>Muſcovite,</hi> his Neighbours, he alloweth his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Victuals, which by his Taxes he provideth at eaſie Rates: He giveth them likewiſe a Coat or Caſſock every year, which maketh them ever fully ready to obey his Commands. The Marriage of the Kings Daughters is at the diſpoſal of the Senate, who give them for their Portion, beſides Silver, Plate, and other Gifts, a 100000. Dollars. Of the Uplandiſh People, which pay not the Impoſt of Victuals, the King is accuſtomed to exact of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Poll acording to his ability, five Dollars or more yearly. 4. His Cuſtomes, that are paid in the Haven Towns, the Chief whereof in <hi>Sweden</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:47448:28"/>are <hi>Caymare, Lodhuys,</hi> and <hi>Stockholme,</hi> where at ſome times four hundred Ships of Burden lye at Anchor: Alſo <hi>Auge, Revel, Riga, Parnovia,</hi> and the <hi>Narve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But theſe Cuſtomes are much improved ſince the Confirmation of his Acquiſts in <hi>Germany,</hi> by the <hi>Munſter</hi> Treaty 1648. by which he had the Upper <hi>Pomerania,</hi> the Inheritance of the Marqueſs of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> with the City of <hi>Wiſmar,</hi> in the Dutchy of <hi>Mecklenbury,</hi> and Iſle of <hi>Rugia,</hi> with the Biſhopricks of <hi>Bremen</hi> and <hi>Verden,</hi> &amp;c. bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering along the other ſide of the <hi>Baltique</hi> Sea; by which he hath a wide inlet into <hi>Germany,</hi> given him in recompence of thoſe Places he had Conquered in the more inward Parts: ſo that this great addition of Territory, hath made him a far more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prince than ever he was; and the <hi>Dane</hi> by ſad Experience found as much in that War he managed againſt him in 1658. when, by the Conjunction and Contiguity of thoſe <hi>German</hi> Provinces, he ſpeeded without Obſtruction out of <hi>Poland,</hi> to ſtop the Progreſs of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Armes, and with ſpeedy ſucceſs reduced that King by the Agreement at <hi>Roſckeild,</hi> to a very petty and pittant Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty; for thereby as good as one half of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was paſſed over to the <hi>Swede,</hi> the Principal Member whereof was <hi>Schoneland,</hi> one of the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt Provinces, but formerly belonging to <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> with ſome other Places, particularly the great <hi>Bayliwick</hi> of <hi>Drontheim</hi> in <hi>Norway,</hi> which would have diſ-membred that Kingdom, and rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Dane</hi> but a precarious Prince of the reſt: But this, and divers other former Conceſſions by
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47448:29"/>that Treaty, were annihilated or retrenched by the ſucceeding Agreement, in the <hi>Swedes</hi> Leageur before <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> after their Defeat in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault of that Town, by the Mediation and Guaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Engliſh, Dutch,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, in <hi>May</hi> 1660. nevertheleſs <hi>Schoneland</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained to the <hi>Swede,</hi> with ſome of the <hi>Baltique</hi> Iſlands; and other Places, not to be particularized in this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>All which Eſtates being laid and joyned together in ſome manner, it were ſuppoſable at firſt view, that he might eaſily render himſelf Maſter of the <hi>Baltique</hi> Sea: but when it is again conſidered, of what ſtrength the <hi>Dane,</hi> the <hi>Hanſe</hi> Towns are, as <hi>Lubeck, Hamborough, Dantzick;</hi> together with the Intereſt of the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the Trade therein, it will ſeem a tougher matter, and too big for his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val ſtrength, which yet of it ſelf is very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: No doubt the <hi>Swede</hi> hath chawed deliciouſly upon the Deſign, but could never digeſt it; it ſufficeth him at preſent, that his Ships are Toll free as they paſs the <hi>Sound:</hi> and that he enjoyeth other Priviledges, which the Violence of his Armes have purchaſed him, of the Princes his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
               <p>As to the Force of this Kingdom, it hath been perceived of what Effect and Puiſſance it is, by that War it carried on, under the late King <hi>Charles Guſtavus,</hi> againſt the <hi>Pole,</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> and the <hi>Muſcovite,</hi> at one and the ſame time: But truly, I cannot tell, whether I may aſcribe thoſe Numbers of Men, with which they have enterpriſed ſo much lately, either to the Production of their own

               <p>As to the Policy of this Kingdom, having touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, that the Government is Monarchical, we will briefly deſcribe the menage of it: Matters of Peace, and War, of Embaſſyes, and Allian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are propoſed by the King to the Senate, for their Reſolution, which the Senators deliver with an entire Liberty, and moſt Voices carry it: but if it happen, that the Vote be contrary to the Kings purpoſes, he will aſſemble the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, to obtain of them what he cannot of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. Theſe Eſtates are compoſed of the Nobility, of the Clergy, of Merchants, and of the Peaſants of the King; that is to ſay, Peaſants that ſerve not Gentlemen (in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Yeomen) but ſubſiſt of themſelves.</p>
               <p>The Nobles that ſit in ſuch Parliaments, or Eſtates General, are of the eldeſt of their Families: the Church ſends two Prieſts of every Community or Dioceſs, the Cities two Merchants, and every Shire two of its Inhabitants: Theſe four Bodies

                  <hi>DENMARK</hi> is bounded on the Eaſt and South with the <hi>Baltique Sea:</hi> On the North with <hi>Norwey</hi> (bounded on the Weſt and North with the <hi>German</hi> and Frozen Sea) and <hi>Sweden,</hi> and on the Weſt the ſaid <hi>German</hi> Ocean. The entire Body of this Kingdom was made up principally in form of three Parts; The Firſt is the Realm of <hi>Denmark,</hi> containing both the <hi>Jutlands,</hi> part of <hi>Scandia</hi> adjoyning upon the <hi>Swedes</hi> Country, as <hi>Halland</hi> (and <hi>Schonen,</hi> which is now in the <hi>Swedes</hi> poſſeſſion) and the Iſlands of the <hi>Baltique Sea.</hi> 2. <hi>Norwey,</hi> To which muſt be added the Iſlands of <hi>Iceland</hi> and <hi>Freezeland</hi> (in the Northern Ocean, where ſuch abundance of Cod is taken by the <hi>Dutch</hi> the <hi>Danes</hi> and Us) of large extent, but of little benefit to this Crown. 3. The Dukedome of <hi>Holſtein</hi> containing 4. Provinces, but now exempt from the Kingdom, and other Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons added to the ſaid Dukedom, which are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47448:31"/>aliened from <hi>Denmark,</hi> of which more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Denmark</hi> lyeth partly in the <hi>Cimbrick Cherſoneſs</hi> adjoyned to the Dukedom of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> as both the <hi>Jutlands</hi> (out of which ſome part is newly borrowed, to adde to the ſaid Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy) divided into ſeveral Diſtricts; and partly in <hi>Scandia,</hi> but principally in the Iſlands. As for the Dutchy of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> it hath of late years been unfortunate to the <hi>Danes,</hi> being over-run by the Imperialiſts in 1628. in the Reign of <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> the 4th. but honeſtly reſtored by the Emperour upon eaſie Conditions: Then it was harraſſed by the <hi>Swede</hi> in 1643. and 4. and now finally freed by them from the Crown of <hi>Denmark,</hi> only the beſt part of <hi>Jutland</hi> remaines in its priſtine obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. In <hi>Scandia, Schonen</hi> being gone, <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Blecking</hi> is all he holds there; and indeed they are fine Provinces, but the unkind ſeparation of their Siſter of <hi>Schonen</hi> (which ſignifies Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) renders them a little unpleaſant to the Kings view and proſpect.</p>
               <p>So that his chiefeſt ſtrength of his Dominions lies in the Iſlands, in number 35. two of which, <hi>Zeland,</hi> and <hi>Fuenen</hi> or <hi>Fionia,</hi> are moſt conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and made more eminently famous by the late <hi>Swediſh</hi> War; the Latter, for the Paſſage of the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> over to it upon the Sea on the Ice, with Horſe, Foot, and his great Artillery, with the loſs only of two Troops: and the Defeat of his Forces there afterwards, by the Confaederate Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: The Other, for the Caſtle of <hi>Cronenburg,</hi> that guards the <hi>Sound;</hi> and <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> the Royal

It is a low Town, ordinarily built, and hath nothing of Magnificence in it, but the Spirit of the Inhabitants; the Kings Palace being no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Building, ſave that its covered with Copper.</p>
               <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Norway,</hi> toward the North, is ſeparated from <hi>Lapland</hi> by high and craggy Rocks, and the Eaſtern and Weſtern Parts are hard to travel for the ſame reaſon. The Land is not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fruitful of Corn, and therefore the Inhabitants (the meaner ſort) eat Stockfiſh, which tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into other Parts, is exchanged for Corn. The Inhabitants are naturally honeſt, and not a Thief among them; and very Civil to Strangers; and formerly very Martial, for theſe People were firſt called <hi>Normans,</hi> and were Anceſtors to our Conquerours; but ſuch is the hard Condition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they are kept by the <hi>Danes,</hi> though in appearance Fellow Subjects, ever ſince the Union of the two Kingdomes, by the Marriage of <hi>Aquinus</hi> in 1359. with <hi>Margaret</hi> the Daughter and Heir of <hi>Waldemar</hi> the 3d. of <hi>Denmark,</hi> (the Iſſue of which Marriage died, and left this Kingdom to the Uſurpation of his Mother <hi>Margaret,</hi> whoſe Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors have continued it to this day) that the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wegians</hi> have wholly loſt their Courage, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Valour, not being ſuffered to go out of the Kingdom to traffique their own Commodities;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47448:32"/>which, beſides Fiſh; are rich Furrs, Tallow, Butter, Tann'd Leather, Train Oyl, Pitch, Clap-board, Maſts, Deal-boards, and Fire-wood; from the Cuſtom whereof ariſeth the Kings greateſt Profits, being received for him at <hi>Bergen</hi> and <hi>Wardhouſe;</hi> but this Revenue is very inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The whole Realm is divided into five Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancies or Governments, which in this unculti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated remote Country, will not concern us in any particulars, no more than the appendixed Iſlands above mentioned.</p>
               <p>Having thus ſummarily diſcourſed of the Parts of this Kingdom, we will briefly mention the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which having been placed in an Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Monarchy from the Foundation of this Eſtate, was challenged as Elective by the Uſurped Power of the Nobles and People, by their Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>Ericus</hi> about 1420. and Electing his Coſen <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> Count Palatine of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> who dying without Iſſue, they again choſe <hi>Adolph,</hi> Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> who excuſing himſelf by reaſon of his age, by his advice, they choſe his Nephew <hi>Chriſtiern,</hi> Earl of <hi>Oldenburg,</hi> who brought both thoſe Eſtates to this Crown: Since when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the faſhion of an Election (but never paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the next Heir) until the year 1660. when, in conſideration of this Kings extraordinary Care, Valour and Vigilance in defence of his People a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Swedes,</hi> they reſolved to reſtore what they had ſo long detained, by returning the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment into the old Channel, and making it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain Haereditary in the Family of this Prince al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though with much reluctancy and diſcontent of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Grandees.</p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:47448:33"/>
               <p>By which change, ſo lately made, there can no perfect account be given of the preſent adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being ſolely at the Kings diſpoſal, as it is with other abſolute Monarchs. As to the Nobles, they are reputed the moſt antient of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Gentry the like; and to preſerve and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that honourable Eſteem, they never match into Plebeian Families, but keep their Blood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix'd and pure in its firſt Current. The Gentry are neither ſo fierce, nor ſo ſubtle as their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and are very generous and hoſpitable to Strangers. The People generally thrifty and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in their Callings, and of very good converſe and civility. The Religion is altogether <hi>Lutheran,</hi> but the Biſhops have more Authority, and better Maintenance here than in <hi>Sweden:</hi> but I know not what they do for a Metropolitan, ſince the Archi-Epiſcopal See of <hi>Londen</hi> in <hi>Schonen,</hi> which was the Primacy of <hi>Denmark,</hi> was aſſigned to the <hi>Swede.</hi> In elder times this Church depended upon the Arch-Biſhoprick of <hi>Bremen,</hi> and then the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Son of the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> (which was in uſe till the Treaty of <hi>Munſter</hi>) was ſtiled the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Bremen;</hi> but that dependance was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to <hi>London</hi> above 500. years ſince, and whether it will be removed now, is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
               <p>The Strength of this Kingdom is moſtly Naval, the <hi>Danes</hi> proving better Water than Land Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and more affecting the Employment; yet of modern times, they have dared alſo by Land; their Conqueſt of <hi>Sweden</hi> was not above 300. years agoe; (not to mention their old Conqueſts with
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47448:33"/>Us) in 1628. they enterpriſed upon the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, in behalf of the Liberty of <hi>Germany</hi> (of which, as Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> he was a free Prince) although unfortunately: Nevertheleſs, the Enemy could not but acknowledge the Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of King <hi>Chriſtiern,</hi> and dealt with him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly: Since which time they were willing to be at quiet, till the opportunity of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> War in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited this King <hi>Frederick</hi> the 3d. to revenge the injurious Violence done to his Country of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> by the <hi>Swedes</hi> in 1643. and 4. which was acted partly by the inſtigation of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the <hi>Dane</hi> ſcrewed up the Rate of the Toll Money in the <hi>Sound,</hi> for which by an old Treaty thoſe <hi>Netherlands</hi> were to pay but a Roſe-Noble for every Ship, without ſearching or viſiting: (and this was paid, becauſe of the Lights, Tuns, and Marks at Sea, kept and maintained by the King of <hi>Denmark;</hi> which Payment, from the time of their ſeparation from <hi>Spain,</hi> he had raiſed at his own pleaſure, ſearching the Ships, and ſeizing the Goods, under pretence of <hi>Contrebanda,</hi> or prohibited Merchandiſe) By a League made in 1640. with the <hi>Swede,</hi> they inſinuated this Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, which alſo offended that Queens Subjects; ſo that in concluſion, the <hi>Dane,</hi> betwixt the <hi>Swedes</hi> Land Forces, and the appearance of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, was forced to a new Agreement with the <hi>Hollander,</hi> at a ſet eaſie rate, for the Toll; which afterwards in 1650. (having made the like defenſive League with the <hi>Dane</hi>) they Farmed at 140000. Peices of 8. <hi>per annum.</hi> for ſome term, with a Proviſo and Caution of not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47448:34"/>ſearched for any Goods, the Maſter only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring what they were,</p>
               <p>To return to an account of his Forces, they may be thus computed. Firſt, Such as the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Gentry are bound to raiſe for the publique ſervice, which are a conſiderable number. And, Secondly, What the People furniſh upon ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; and theſe have formerly amounted to great Armies: But the ſtrength of the Kingdom is now exhauſted, and it is yet able to do little.</p>
               <p>The preceding diſcourſe leads me to conſider of this Kings Revenue, which chiefly conſiſts in his Toll upon Ships aforeſaid, (for he makes little of his own Cuſtomes, Fiſh being his greateſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, and no great Port of Trade in all his Realm) which hath fallen much ſince his late Agreement with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who have the ſole Trade here almoſt; and more by the Northern Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> found out many years ſince. He had alſo a Toll of 50000. Oxen, which went year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of <hi>North Jutland</hi> into <hi>Germany</hi> by <hi>Holſtein,</hi> but the Duke now receives that at his Toll-houſe, erected at his Reſidence of <hi>Gottorp.</hi> There are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſome Crown Lands, but they do not amount to any conſiderable Revenue.</p>
               <p>The Intereſt of <hi>Denmark</hi> is, by no means to diſ-oblige the Emperour, as his ſureſt Friend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Swede;</hi> nor the <hi>Hollander,</hi> unleſs upon inſolent Encroachments, againſt which he hath the King of <hi>England,</hi> his neareſt Ally, to a ſure Friend and Defence; to watch and keep fair with the <hi>Swede,</hi> his conſtant and natural Enemy; and to that purpoſe, to keep the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> alwayes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jealouſied
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47448:34"/>of their Greatneſs; to be at League with all the <hi>German</hi> Princes, and make his Intereſt as ſtrong with them as is poſſible; to be perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Confaederated with the <hi>Pole,</hi> Offenſively and Defenſively; and ſo to cheriſh the <hi>French</hi> Kings Friendſhip, as to keep him a Neuter betwixt the <hi>Swede</hi> and himſelf; Laſtly, to love and reſpect the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> above all other Friendſhips whatſoever. With other Princes than theſe he hath no Concern, only a civil Correſpondence with <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> in point of Trade and Commerce.</p>
               <p>What he can do againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> or what Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply he can give the Emperour, may appear by the preceding Diſcourſe, the late Wars having utterly diſabled him, ſo that, beſides his good will, and his Prayers, he can no way advantage the Chriſtian Cauſe, without much deſpoyling and injuring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which that Occaſion cannot expect, and perchance will not need. And it is moſt certain, that the <hi>Turk</hi> took his Reſolution of the late Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, from the Embaraſſement and Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two Northern Kings, in which the Emperour, the <hi>Pole,</hi> and the Marqueſs of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg,</hi> were ſo far engaged; ſo that having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſufficiently, and he being the only loſer upon that account, he may well be excuſed: And ſo we paſs to the Dutchy of <hi>Holſtein.</hi>

               <p>It is ſeated in the Southern part of the <hi>Cimbrick Cherſoneſs,</hi> or the <hi>Peninſula</hi> made by the <hi>Baltique</hi> Sea on the <hi>German</hi> ſhore, and is divided from the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Provinces of <hi>Jutland</hi> by the River <hi>Eydore:</hi> It contains four Provinces, <hi>viz.

The whole <hi>Peninſula</hi> is but 75 miles in length, and 60 in breadth, with the 2 <hi>Jutlands</hi> belonging to the King of <hi>Denmark;</hi> ſo that this Dutchy can be reputed of little force, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it conſiſt of a great number of walled Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Towns, and is very populous, but the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the ſaid two Hanſe Towns, and the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> part, retrench the eſtimate of its force.</p>

               <p>THeſe Countries are bounded on the North and Weſt with the <hi>German</hi> Ocean, on the Eaſt with part of <hi>Germany,</hi> and on the South with <hi>Flanders,</hi> &amp;c. They were once under ſeveral Lords and State-holders, who by the Power, and their Intereſt with the Emperours of <hi>Germany,</hi> made themſelves abſolute; from whom, by the Marriage of their Heirs General, they devolved at laſt into the Soveraignty of the Dukes of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi> whoſe Daughter conveyed them to <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian</hi> Arch-Duke of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> By his Grand-Son <hi>Charles</hi> the 5th. they were deſigned to be made with the other ten Provinces, one entire Kingdom: but the Diſcrepancy of their Laws and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47448:37"/>Cuſtomes, and the irreconcilable Contrariety thereof, made him give over that Reſolution.</p>
               <p>About the Year of our Lord 1567. at what time the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> raged againſt all theſe Provinces, they ſhook off the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Yoak, and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Philip</hi> the 2d.

               <p>Now the Cement and Principles of theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faederate States, and the Contracts by which they are Combined together, and by which they have ſo gloriouſly ſubſiſted, come next, under a brief Conſideration. The Firſt of them is; That they ſhall continue inſeparably united, nor ſhall act di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly in the common Affairs. 2. The Rights, Priviledges, and Franchiſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Province, ſhall be continued inviolate. 3. They ſhall ſtrennuouſly aſſiſt one another; and if any Difference ariſe between two Places, they ſhall ſubmit to the ordinary Courſe of Juſtice; and ſhall attempt nothing to the prejudice of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 4. They ſhall mutually aid and defend one another againſt the Armes of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſhall ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize with one anothers Loſſes, 5. The new Fortreſſes ſhall be made at the common Charge, but the Frontiers at the particular Charge of each Province. 6. Peace, War, or Truce, not to be made without the common Conſent of all the Eſtates and People. 7. Liberty of Conſcience ſhall be allowed. 8. All Care ſhall be uſed by each particular Province, and all of them in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that they give no Cauſe of Quarrel or Offence, whereby they ſhould become engaged in any other War, than that of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe were the Originalls of this Republique, and the Fundamental Laws thereof; we will now ſee the Practice and Execution of them, in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, and the Policy of the Government. 1. Every City of theſe United Provinces, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges its particular Magiſtrate; the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Magiſtrate, and the Colledge of the Lords,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47448:38"/>the States-General. By the Magiſtrate of the City, are underſtood the Councellours, whoſe total number is forty; (which are paid for their ſervice, and hold their Places for life, becauſe they may act freely, without thoſe reſentments of a future pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Condition; theſe deliberate of the Affairs of the Province, and inſpect and chooſe all other Magiſtrates, and are in effect the Peoples Servants, as they will ſometimes taunt them) the Burgo-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and Sheriffs, together with a Baily, who judgeth abſolutely in Criminal Cauſes; but he holds his Place not longer than <hi>Durante Placito,</hi> of the Council of the City.</p>
               <p>The Provincial Magiſtracy is compoſed of a Councellour of every City of the Province, whoſe Office is to Conſerve its Priviledges and Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; to this Court there lies an Appeal from the Sentence of the Sheriffs Court.</p>
               <p>The Colledge or Aſſembly of the Lords States General, is conſtituted of the Deputies of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Councils; theſe make the Alliances, and Treaties, or War with foreign Princes and States; and theſe raiſe Money, and impoſe Taxes, and take the Care of the Peace and well-Being of the Publique. In this Aſſembly, one of the Aſſeſſors, or Penſionary Counſellours, opens the Matter or Affair in a proportion, which the Deputies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, but give no anſwer till they have received one from the Provincial Councils, who likewiſe muſt be reſolved by the reſpective Cities, which makes State Buſineſs very tedious, but that's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed by a good digeſtion, and mature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration. So that the Soveraignty reſides not in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47448:38"/>the Aſſembly of the States General, although they ſeem to have all the Power, but in the Eſtates of every Province, and the Council of the Cities. In effect, the Cities frame their particular Laws, and do their own buſineſs, without communicating it to the States General: But the States General cannot undertake any thing, without firſt writing to the Provinces, and obliging their Negotiation with the Cities, to obtain the permiſſion of their Determinations.</p>
               <p>The States General meet at the <hi>Hague,</hi> where every Province preſides weekly; Every Province ſends one or more Deputies, who all of them make but one Voice; Each Province takes Place of other in their own Territory, to preſerve Aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and their Votes are of the ſame Validity: Every Province likewiſe Payes its own Deputies, and changeth them once in three years, to make room for others to finger the Government; but they muſt be ſuch as have Deſert and Eſtates, that they may ſolely intend the Publique, without De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment to their private Fortune.</p>
               <p>The People are generally good natured to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and free in their Converſe one to another; their Looks very vivacious and pleaſant: yet are they wondrous ſubtle and prudent, and love in things moſt exceſſively <hi>Money</hi> and <hi>Liberty:</hi> But ſuch the Capricies concerning the latter, that they ſute that Character of <hi>Tacitus; Nec poſſunt Liberta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, nec Servitutem pati:</hi> Or that of <hi>Strada,</hi> which comes neareſt the matter; <hi>Nulli magis Servitutem execrantur, nulli melius patiuntur;</hi> They can neither endure Servitude nor Freedom: for every man will
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47448:39"/>take upon himſelf to rectifie the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and in this their Preſſes are very ſcandalous. As to the latter, the many miſeries &amp; violences they have done to Trade in all Nations of the World, both by private Men, and publique Commiſſion, have made it too notorious; and this Kingdom chiefly feeleth the Miſchief thereof. And here were oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeak of thoſe Encroachments, both up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Fiſhing at Home, and our Traffique Abroad, eſpecially in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> where they have in a manner engroſſed all the Trade: Not to mention their Attempts upon <hi>Guinea,</hi> and their Inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies committed there. By which means, in a few years, if un-interrupted, they will gain all the Wealth in the World into their Hands; which that they drive at, is apparent by thoſe vaſt Fleets they have for a good while maintained in thoſe <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Seas, and thoſe Acquiſts they have made by Land there alſo; ſo that they are Formidable to all the Princes of thoſe Parts: And it is very Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the repute and dread they have gotten there, is partly obliged to a quantity of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Seamen, whom they have for ſome late time em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed and ſhipped upon Voyages to thoſe Coaſts, and left them diſperſed in Garriſons, contrary to Articles and Agreement made at their Embarquing; by which means they deprive us alſo of Seamen. But to proceed.</p>
               <p>They have been declared a Free State, and the High and Mighty Lords the States General, ever ſince 1648. when the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> wearied with a 80. years War, was more than willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh his Claim, and Regal Title, (being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47448:39"/>and engaged on the other ſide with the <hi>French</hi>) for that the <hi>Dutch</hi> were obſtinately bent againſt a Peace with him: Nevertheleſs Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> their General, and State-holder, being induced thereunto by great Advantages to himſelf and Family, as well as the States, it took effect. Since which, they concerned themſelves, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>French,</hi> nor the <hi>Spaniard</hi> grew too Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in the Low Countries; and to that purpoſe, maintained a good Correſpondence with their new reconciled Enemy, ſupplying him with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in his Diſtreſſes, upon ſecurity of his Plate Fleet, in which they have deeply intereſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: who likewiſe omitted no Courtſhip nor Civility, to oblige them to his ſide.</p>
               <p>Being thus abſolute, and look'd upon as one of the moſt conſiderable Members of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> their Ambition and Arrogance tranſported them to quarrel with the new uſurping States of <hi>England,</hi> as their Juniors, and to try Title for the Dominion of the Sea, and all things ſeemed to favour the Enterpriſe, for the State had been in ſore Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles newly before, by the Intereſt of the Prince of <hi>Aurange,</hi> the Husband of the Princeſs Royal; who perceived the Republicans began to grow weary of his Authority, by which, and the Merit of his Anceſtors, they had attained to their preſent Greatneſs; but he dying ſoon after, all mention of thoſe matters was laid aſide, and the Common-Wealth Faction predominated every where.</p>
               <p>It is true, ſome of thoſe Grandees, after the ill ſucceſs of the War, cunningly ſhifted the engaging in, and inducement to it, upon that Princes

               <p>By this War, when they might have boaſted of a precarious Peace, granted by them to our new Coddled States, who courted, and earneſtly ſought their Republican Friendſhip, out of fear of the joynt revenge of all the Kings of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> for their late perpetrated Regicide, they were redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a very low Ebbe; and they may thank the Protectoral Revolution, that they were not left dry, and exhauſted, and the Sea wholly debarred from them, but what they ſayled by our permiſſion.

               <p>With this gallant Perſons Death, the <hi>Dutch</hi> reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Fighting changed into milder &amp; humbler thoughts: but ſad was the face of this Country, upon the return of their Fleet, ſo maimed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manned; nor did they forbear to deplore this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable loſs, and to demand openly a ſudden Peace with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> with whom if they were Friends, they would defie the World: And now their Governours were blamed, for commencing ſuch a deſtructive Enterpriſe, (and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants, and others, highly carreſſed, who ſome while before had changed &amp; transferred their Staple from <hi>Rotterdam</hi> to <hi>Dort</hi>) and they terribly threatned, if it were not quickly ſet an end to, and compoſed, by any manner of Agreement: And yet as ſoon as it was concluded, they fell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47448:42"/>to their old Depraedations in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and have continued them there, and elſewhere, ever ſince. So natural it is for theſe People to take all advantages for gain; and ſuch the dilatory proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of their Courts of Juſtice, and removal from one Chamber of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company (which are ſix in all, <hi>viz.</hi> Of <hi>Amſterdam, Delf, Rotterdam, Middleburgh,</hi> &amp;c.) to another, that it is a worſe vexation to proſecute the recovery, than is the loſs of our Goods; as might be inſtanced in the Caſe of thoſe intereſſed in Squire <hi>Courtens</hi> Ships; (who loſt not only the Ships and Goods, but his Factories alſo, the beſt and richeſt in all the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> and ever ſince 1643. poſſeſſed by that means by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> for that Squire <hi>Courten</hi> was thereby wholly deprived of any means to ſupply them) and this one thing hath proved as great a Damage to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, as any Action of theirs ſince <hi>Amboyna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have been thus liberal in diſcourſing of their Trade, becauſe it is the Soul, nay, the beſt part of the Body of this little vaſt Republique; and is the only conſiderable thing: For alaſs, what are thoſe puny Provinces they till and manure, and make Paſture of, (and much of that torn from their better Parent the Sea) to be compared with thoſe vaſt Regions they poſſeſs abroad? So that <hi>Holland</hi> ſeems to be the Hive; but the ſweet Flowers from whence the Honey is gathered, and with which they ſuſtain themſelves, are planted in more bleſſed Countries. It hath been ſaid, and it is true, that the Bank of <hi>Venice</hi> gives Law and Rule to the Exchange of Money in <hi>Europe:</hi> and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47448:42"/>hereafter it may be ſaid, if the <hi>Dutch</hi> Trade go on thus, it will give Law to all Trade through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World, if it preſume not alſo to the Sword.</p>
               <p>And as they are thus careful and induſtrious for their profit and glory in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> where they aſpire to an univerſal Soveraignty, and have already intitled themſelves to the Southern Seas: ſo do they as diligently mind their near Concern in the <hi>Baltique</hi> Sea, and the Trade about the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Cape to <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> of which we had experience in their ſtickling ſo between the two Northern Kings, And although they were adventrouſly engaged in that Buſineſs by the <hi>Brandenburger,</hi> their old Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faederate and Ally by the Houſe of <hi>Orange,</hi> who afterwards left them to their own Councils: yet did they at laſt come off handſomely with the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> by the Treaty of <hi>Elbing</hi> 1657. though with great loſs of Money; and afterwards more gloriouſly with him, when, by their aſſiſtance gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> 1659. they made the <hi>Swede</hi> to underſtand, that He could not be Maſter of the <hi>Sound</hi> without their leave. As for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> they carry fair with him, and cheat him ſufficiently, but yet they find good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect from him, and a kind Correſpondence; ſo that he will be no Enemy to them, unleſs upon an <hi>Engliſh</hi> account, which he highly prefers.</p>
               <p>And incredible is the Profit which ariſeth by their Trade out of thoſe Countries by Corn, (which they diſperſe into <hi>Europe</hi>) Hemp, Tarr, Cordage, Maſts, Deal-boards, Clap-boards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they have in Exchange for their Spices from
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47448:43"/>
                  <hi>India;</hi> ſo that 600. Sayl have gone together out of the <hi>Texel</hi> for the <hi>Baltique</hi> Sea: Nor is their Herring Fiſhing leſs conſiderable, of which they make three Millions Sterling yearly, and of Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh little leſs, beſide their Whale Fiſhing; ſo that they do not trade and barter for leſs than forty Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions yearly. Now to encourage People to ſettle themſelves with them, and to carry on their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation: they give great and equal Priviledges to all Commers; nor are the Duties upon Goods Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported or Imported, any way ſo conſiderable as in other Kingdomes: Beſides, they will not ſuffer any Corporations, or the Encloſure of any Trade, but it ſhall be free for all men, either to Voyage whither they pleaſe, or to adventure their Money on the joynt Stock, that menageth that Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without any diſtinction or difference what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; which courſes, with their Toleration of all Religions, have made them ſo thrive in this manner, and to be ſo Populous as they are at this day.</p>
               <p>We come now to ſpeak of their Forces, and their preſent Poſture, which is chiefly Naval, as may be concluded from the fore-going diſcourſe; and that Naval Power ſuppoſed to be greater and better now than e're it was, ſo that they can arm and man 200. Ships of War built for ſervice in a very ſhort time, and upon a ſudden alarum, but we will leave that to time. Certainly they are well provided, but it is as much certain, they care not for a War, eſpecially with the <hi>Englſh,</hi> it being ſo contrary to their Intereſt, that every Cabbin Boy will not endure to hear of it. He that reads their
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47448:43"/>Books Printed upon this ſubject, will perceive as much, together, with what fine Artifices they have contrived to flur their Miſdemeanours, and compound them under-hand by Friends; and this is avowedly laid down, as a method to Satisfaction beyond all Compariſon: And then their Tempori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, and peremptory Promiſes, is another Shift, which may chance to help them to better Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities. At this preſent they aſſure the King of giving him Content, and have promiſed him to call a General Aſſembly of the Eſtates to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: And by an expreſs Envoy, have intreated his Majeſty, to take off the Quarantayn or Demoorage upon their Ships, by reaſon of the Plague; but there's more ſtiffneſs in the wind.</p>
               <p>As to their Land Forces, they alwayes keep up a ſtanding Militia, both for fear of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> their near Neighbour, and for all Emergencies at home; but of late they have reduced it to a leſs number than formerly; notwithſtanding, it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for Defence, and for any ſudden Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if they want upon any Rupture, their Money will raiſe them Souldiers: but the great Armies they maintained under the Princes of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi> for the gaining of one Town in a Summer, makes 'um now very parſimonious.</p>
               <p>They are now in firm League both with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and all the other Princes of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> (excepting ſome Piques in <hi>Eaſt-Friezland,</hi> about the <hi>Eyler Sconce,</hi> with the Earl thereof, which Prince <hi>William,</hi> by their order, beſieged, and had it yielded, during a Treaty above) ſo that they have leiſure (if they mean to be honeſt with Us)
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47448:44"/>to revenge themſelves of the <hi>Algier</hi> Pirates, who have done them moſt deſpiteful outrages: and to ſupply the Emperour with ſome aſſiſtance by Land, which is the Conſideration of this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>And indeed, there are no People ſo engaged to aſſiſt againſt this Enemy, as theſe, eſpecially by Sea, where they themſelves have made them thus powerful to do miſchief, by yielding their Ships to them without ſtriking one blow, (which, by the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Cuſtom, gives Liberty to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, upon ſuch innocent and ſpeedy rendition) which Ships have formerly ſerved for the Piratical Trade, till with thoſe they took better of theirs, and ſo framed their Modules. They have now a Fleet, under <hi>De Ruyter,</hi> preparing to ſet ſail for <hi>Algier,</hi> but upon no other account, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their Inſolencies; not intending to give any offence to the <hi>Grand Seigniour,</hi> whoſe Coaſts and Maritime Places, a Conjunction of the Chriſtian Fleets now hovering in the Streights, would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reduce, and do him thereby a great deal of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, if the War were proſecuted; otherwiſe it we e labour and time loſt. As for Land ſervice, they have the ſame convenient paſſage for them to <hi>Hungary,</hi> as the Princes and Provinces of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> if they were free, and open-hearted, in this time of danger; but it is to be feared, the Emperours Ambaſſadour will not have his anſwer from them in any reaſonable time, or that it will no prove ſatisfactory and effectual, for they have little inclinations to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> unleſs the Caſe prove very dangerous, and threaten them nearer: And there is a Saying of a former <hi>Grand
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47448:44"/>Siegniour; That if they ſhould have provoked him, as they did their Soveraign the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>he would have ſent Fellows with Shovels, and have thrown that little Mariſh into the Sea.</hi> Of late they have driven a great Trade in his Countries, till very now, and the War in <hi>Hungary,</hi> (by which our Cloaths are riſen there to good price and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation) and do all they can to maintain a good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence at the Port; where, and in other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they enjoy the Priviledge of Ambaſſadours or Conſuls. I would not omit, that they have been long and much preſſed by the <hi>French,</hi> and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique King, and ſometimes by our Soveraign, at the inſtance of the <hi>Grand Maſter,</hi> and Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> to make Reſtitution to that Order, of ſome Lands they enjoy and poſſeſs of theirs, in the <hi>Low Countries;</hi> but they take it unkindly, to be urged to ſuch ſtale Demands and Pretenſions.</p>
               <p>The Intereſt of <hi>Holland</hi> is conſiderable in a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reſpect, either to Land or Sea. As to the Land, they are obliged to look to their Frontires, and maintain their Places of Strength, as thoſe that will ſecure them beſt, it having been proved by experience, that one Leagure hath deſtroyed whole Armies. They are likewiſe concerned to keep their Common-Wealth free from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances that may ariſe by the Eſtates of ſome petty Soveraignties, that are within their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts, and out of their Juriſdiction, for fear of Potent Intereſts in the Quarrel, from their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and therefore to ſuppreſs them with all ſpeed: Of this nature there are ſome Places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Earl of <hi>Eaſt-Friezland,</hi> ſome to the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:47448:45"/>Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> as the <hi>Eyler Sconce,</hi> about which the preſent Troubles are ariſen, by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of that Garriſon, as is pretended; and the Earldom of <hi>Culenburg</hi> in <hi>Guelderland,</hi> (the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Buren,</hi> the fair Patrimony of the Prince of <hi>Aurange,</hi> in the ſame Province) ſeparated from the Dutchy of <hi>Guelderland,</hi> and ſo dignified by King <hi>Philp</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> who had reſpect to the entire and rich Situation thereof, with its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions and Appurtenances. This Earl is likewiſe in a readineſs to be embroyled with the <hi>Hollander</hi> about the ſame ſcore, and its Credible he hath Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to back him. They are alſo more nearly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed, that the <hi>French,</hi> nor no other Potent Prince, get any further footing in <hi>Flanders,</hi> upon the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who is the beſt, and moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious Neighbour they can have. They muſt keep fair with the Prince of <hi>Aurange,</hi> and abridge him of no Rights his Predeceſſors enjoyed; but of his Concerns we ſhall ſpeak more particularly in the Original of his Family in <hi>Germany.</hi> An even and equal hand muſt be carried between the <hi>Swede</hi> and the <hi>Dane;</hi> and they muſt have good Friends in <hi>Germany,</hi> of which <hi>Brandenburg</hi> will alwayes be one, and moſt of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Princes, whom they keep at their Devotion with ſome ſmall Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or Kindneſſes done them.</p>
               <p>As to the Sea, there is a neceſſity of a firm Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the <hi>Hanſe</hi> Towns, not in point of Commerce, for they grudge them any ſociety in it, but out of ſecurity to their own, in Caſe of a Rupture; for by their entitling themſelves to <hi>Lubeck</hi> and <hi>Hamburg,</hi> and the like Places, in
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:47448:45"/>the late War between them and Us, they cheated Us of many conſiderable Prizes, which were own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe Cities. As to the <hi>French,</hi> they muſt be likewiſe firmly Leagued, for the benefit of their Ports, and the protection of their Shore, if they gain not ſomething elſe of that King in Caſe of War. As to the <hi>Portugal,</hi> they muſt, as Caſes go, ſuffer him to go away with his Conqueſts in <hi>Braſile,</hi> whatever amends they make themſelves in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> by their late taking of ſome Places there, and the further progreſs of their Armes in thoſe Parts; but it is ſuppoſed, they have ſome aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect upon the ſame <hi>Braſile.</hi> As to the <hi>Turk,</hi> ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient hath been ſpoken concerning them in the Premiſſes.</p>
               <p>I ſhould have deſcribed the Situation, but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo near a Neighbour to Us, I ſuppoſe it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary; all therefore that I ſhall adde, is, that it is conveniently and commodiouſly ſeated for Trade with all the Provinces of <hi>Europe,</hi> either by Land or Sea. For the Air, it is indifferent, according to the Seaſon of the Year: And ſo we paſs to the other ten Provinces, under the Juriſdiction to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>

For the Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, it is ſo different, in reſpect of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular Province, and ſo well known to our Nation, that I will not ſtand to deſcribe it. The Country is generally very pleaſant, and far exceeds the 7. United Provinces for Corn, Grain, and production of Cattel; and affords all manner of good Diet, in a plenteous manner; and a very

And indeed it is one of the fineſt Places in the World, famous for its Exchange, from whence ours was patterned, and that general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort made it ſo ſome a 100. years agoe from all Parts of the World, when <hi>Amſterdam</hi> was in its Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and might never have riſen to any grown Eſtate, but for the War with <hi>Spain,</hi> which eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the luſtre of this Miſtriſs of all Negotiation, and pent her up in the Shallows of the River <hi>Scheld,</hi> (hard by the Sea Port Towns of <hi>Middle-borough</hi> and <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> and the Block-houſe of <hi>Lillo</hi>) which had had all the Deeps flowing in upon her with the Treaſures of the World. And in this Condition ſhe yet remaines, an Impoſt being ſtill paid to the <hi>Dutch</hi> for all Goods paſſing from

                  <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> by <hi>Lillo,</hi> and ſo thither: It continueth nevertheleſs the reſidence of many wealthy <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants, (and of all Nations beſides) who live there in great ſplendour, and are highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected by the civil Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>The Government being Monarchical, with the Intervention of the Eſtates of the Country, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe upon occaſions, and the raiſing of Moneys, it will be unneceſſary to give a further account thereof, becauſe common, and the ſame with all Regal Adminiſtration, ſave that this is not ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute as other Soveraignties; for although the Houſe of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> by a ſtanding Militia, raiſed at firſt (and paid by the conſent of the Eſtates) for the Honour and Majeſty of their Perſons, which they increaſed afterwards at their pleaſure to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable number of <hi>Gens d' Armes,</hi> did keep them very low; and the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> (into whoſe Patrimony this Princely Eſtate fell, with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the ſole Daughter of <hi>Burgundy</hi> to the Arch-Duke <hi>Maximilian</hi>) endeavoured to ſubju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate them totally by the ſame and other Means and Policies; upon which followed many terrible Revolts, particularly that of <hi>Ghendt:</hi> yet could they not be brought to abandon their Pretenſions to Liberty, the Terms and Name whereof they held as precious Reliques, and would boldly talk of them, though to no effect. But when the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> by their valiant ſtrugling, had ſhook the Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> and as good as ſhook off that Yoak; that King found it high time to carry a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſweet hand over thoſe Provinces that remained in his Subjection, and their Allegiance, and gave
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:47448:47"/>them that <hi>Gratis,</hi> which the other had extorted, although not to that full Liberty, yet as much as ſatisfied this People; who being addicted to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, (which was the main Grievance of the Revolters) and eaſed in point of Taxes, were content with their old Maſter; being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of a more tractable and ducible temper, than the ſtiffe and ſtorm-driven <hi>Hollander,</hi> who could never compoſe or quiet his thoughts after the firſt rupture.</p>
               <p>And indeed, had not theſe People been faſt and ſure in Allegiance, which was ſweetned to them by many Acts of Grace, this King had never been able to have withſtood ſuch Potent Enemies, as for 12. years together, from 1636. to 1648. ſet upon him on both ſides; notwithſtanding, in which year, or ſomewhat ſooner, without doubt he had been driven out of this Country, betwixt the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and the Prey ſhared betwixt them; but that the <hi>Dutch</hi> were more jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the <hi>French,</hi> as a potenter and nearer Neighbour, whoſe entire ſtrength might at one time be powred in upon them: So, that although they made a ſhow of purſuing their Confaederacy in 1646. and ſo to 48. yet in the mean while, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the <hi>French</hi> Inſtances to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary by Mounſieur <hi>Servient</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi> they ſecretly proceeded to an Agreement with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and finally concluded it at <hi>Munſter</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid. By which means, the more Northernly and Weſternly Provinces, as <hi>Brabant, Namur,</hi> &amp;c. had a diſcharged reſpite from the haraſs of War, but the Eaſternly and Southerly ſuffered as much as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from the <hi>French.</hi>

               <p>As to the Forces of theſe Provinces, it is, and hath appeared to be very redoubted; the <hi>Walloons</hi> being excellent Souldiers, both for Horſe and Foot, as they have approved themſelves, both at Home and Abroad: nor are they leſs numerous; beſides, the Gentry are very ready to the ſervice of their Prince and Country.

               <p>But there is nothing in <hi>France</hi> more worthy the noting, than the number and pleaſure of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable Rivers, whereof ſome as it were gird in the whole Realm, as <hi>Sagona, Rhoſne,</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel;</hi> ſome other cut through the middle, as the <hi>Sequan</hi> or <hi>Seyn, Layre,</hi> and <hi>Garon;</hi> Into theſe Streams fall ſo many other Rivers, ſome from the utmoſt bounds, ſome from the inmoſt Parts of the Realm, that it maketh the whole Country commodious for Traffique and Exchange of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Wants: Inſomuch, that by this facility of carriage, and intercourſe of Merchants, all things may be ſaid to be in common to the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. In <hi>Anjou</hi> alone are forty Rivers, great and ſmall, whereupon Q. <hi>Katherin de Medicis</hi> was wont to ſay; <hi>That this Kingdom contained more Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, than all</hi> Europe <hi>beſides:</hi> This indeed was an Hyperbolical Speech, yet ſomething of affinity to truth. And we ſee, that this eaſie and ready con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, with the goodneſs and luxuriance of the Soyl, hath been the original of ſo many great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and good Towns, in this Kingdom, and thoſe moſt commonly ſeated upon the Banks of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. And although it have many goodly Havens, yet the Up-land Towns are fairer and richer than thoſe that ſtand near the Sea, <hi>Marſeilles</hi> excepted;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47448:51"/>which argueth their wealth to be their own, and not brought from foreign Countries; for there the Sea Towns excell thoſe of the Land, as <hi>Genoa, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, Ragula:</hi> but where the proſperity of Cities dependeth wholly upon the Land, there it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, as in <hi>Millain, Nurenberg,</hi> and moſt of the Towns of <hi>Germany, Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Hungary.</hi> All this notwithſtanding, although almoſt like goodneſs of Soyl be proper to the whole Realm of <hi>France,</hi> as likewiſe the ſituation of the Rivers commodious; yet, <hi>Paris</hi> excepted, (whoſe largeneſs proceedeth from the Kings Court, the Parliament, and the Univerſity) the Towns there are for the moſt part but ſmall and mean, yet beautiful, commodious, and very populous; ſo that, in a Deſcription of the Number of this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, written in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the 9th. it is aſſerted, that the Number of the Inhabitants ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded 15. Millions.</p>
               <p>And as the Cities and Towns in <hi>France</hi> may boaſt of their Rivers, ſo the Caſtles and Villages of Noblemen are no leſs pleaſured and favoured with the pleaſure and ſtrength of Lakes and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes; which, although they may not be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to thoſe of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Switzerland:</hi> yet are they ſo many, and ſo fall of excellent Fiſh, that the numbers of the one may aequal the largeneſs of the other. The ſame may be ſpoken of Woods, not ſo well as thick grown, out of thoſe Woods in times paſt the Kings Revenue did ariſe, and the Noblemen do make great profit, by ſelling great quantities thereof for fire-wood; but greater by ſales of Timber Trees, which they uſe, for want
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47448:52"/>of Stone, in the greateſt part of their Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>
               <p>In regard of the commodious ſituation and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of theſe Rivers, ſerving ſo fitly for the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of Victuals from one place to another, this Kingdom is ſo abundantly furniſhed with all plenty of Proviſion, that it is able to nouriſh an Army in the Field, how multitudinous ſoever. When <hi>Charles</hi> the 5th. entred <hi>France,</hi> firſt by <hi>Provence,</hi> and afterwards by <hi>Champaign,</hi> it main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained One hundred and fifty thouſand Souldiers, beſides the ord nary Garriſons. In the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the 9th. (and ſince that, in the time of the League, a greater number) there were main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Kingdom 20000. Horſe, 30000. Footmen Strangers, and of <hi>French</hi> 25000. Horſe, and 100000. Foot.</p>
               <p>Beſides this plenty, there is enough to ſpare, being four wayes or Loadſtones to draw Riches from foreign Nations 1. Corn, carried into <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugall.</hi> 2. Wines, tranſported into <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and the Inhabitants of the <hi>Baltique</hi> Sea. Together with Salt, wherewith the whole Kingdom, and the bordering Nations are plentifully ſtored. This Salt s made in <hi>Provence,</hi> of the ſalt water of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea; and at <hi>Brouage</hi> in <hi>Xaintong,</hi> where the heat of the Sun ceaſeth his vertue of making, getting, and boyling Salt of Sea water, not daring to yield ſo great a favour any farther Northward; I mean of Sea water, becauſe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther North there is Salt found alſo, but made ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſome ſpecial Spring water, as in <hi>Lorrain;</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:47448:52"/>or compound of ſome Mineralls, mix'd with freſh waters, as in <hi>Poland, England, Germany;</hi> or elſe taken forth of ſome Salt Mines, as were once in <hi>Sweveland;</hi> but of this Merchandiſe of Salt, ſomething more ſhall be ſaid hereafter. The 4. and laſt Commodity, is Canvaſs, and Linnen Cloth, whereof what profit ariſeth is hardly cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible to thoſe who have not made an inſpection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; what abundance thereof is carried into <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> alſo, to make Sayls for the furniſhing of Shipping? There groweth alſo Woad, Saffron, and other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe of ſmaller value; which, though they ariſe not to aequalize the above-ſaid Commodities, yet they ariſe to a competent ſumm; ſo that the Emperour <hi>Maximillian</hi> uſed to ſay; <hi>That</hi> France <hi>was a continual flouriſhing Medow, which the King did mow as oft as he liſted.</hi> And Foreigners, from the mouth of <hi>Maximillian</hi> the Emperour, who Charactered the ſeveral Princes and Subjects of <hi>Europe,</hi> call him, <hi>Rex aſinorum,</hi> for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Burdens and Preſſures he layes upon his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; ſo that in <hi>Normandy</hi> the Peaſants wear wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Shooes, and neither eat nor drink, Fleſh, Wine, or Beer, throughout the year.</p>
               <p>Having intimated before that we ſhould not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel this Country, for that it is ſo generally known; we will ſurvey only thoſe places that are of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern concernment: Omitting therefore the names of ſome eminent places, which have given title to the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> as <hi>Valois, Bourbon,</hi> which aſpect the Hiſtory, but are far deducible, and ſuppoſed to be generally known; (here alſo, to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47448:53"/>paſs by the <hi>Sabique</hi> Law, which admits no female to a Scepter; under pretence whereof our <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the 3d. was put from his title to <hi>France,</hi> by <hi>Philip</hi> the firſt King of the Houſe of <hi>Valois</hi>) we will mention only three places, which of all the Members and Provinces of <hi>France</hi> keep themſelves yet diſtinct and abſolute Soveraignties, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the <hi>French</hi> Kings in all times endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the Union of the like parcels to the Crown; witneſs the Dutchy of <hi>Britany,</hi> of ſome late Ages; and now the Principality of <hi>Aurange,</hi> the County of <hi>Venaſcine,</hi> or the Papal Juriſdiction of <hi>Avignon;</hi> and laſtly, the Dutchy of <hi>Nivernois,</hi> all which are totally exempt from any dependance on the Crown.</p>
               <p>The Principality of <hi>Orange</hi> did belong to the County of <hi>Provence,</hi> as did <hi>Avignion,</hi> being Tributaries thereto, and made 2 parts of 3; the other being for many years in the Kings poſſeſſion, by the reſignation of the laſt Earl of <hi>Provence,</hi> who died iſſue-leſs, and is governed by a Parliament held at <hi>Aix.</hi> This Principality was once in the Poſſeſſion of the noble family of <hi>Chaalons,</hi> who had it in marriage with an Heir General, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the abſolute Soveraignty thereof from the Earl of <hi>Province;</hi> with the Priviledge of Coyning, and all other Royalties added to the Title of Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> by the Grace of God. To this Family ſucceeded the Houſe of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> by their marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the Heir General likewiſe, about the year 1500. in which Houſe it hath ever ſince conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued without any diſturbance, until the year 1660. In the beginning whereof, the Cardinal

                  <hi>Mazarine</hi> ſeeing the Reſtitution of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, reſolved to ſeize it into the <hi>French</hi> Kings hands, before any ſtop might be put to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings by our Kings Intervention, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly by menaces to the Count of <hi>Dhona</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and other artifices (upon pretence of miſdemeanours and outrages committed by thoſe Proteſtant People upon their Catholique Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, to the endangering the Peace) by a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty managed by Monſieur <hi>Jure Millet,</hi> the Kings Commiſſioner, poſſeſſed himſelf of the Town, Caſtle, and Principality, upon Condition to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, with all the ſtores, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Prince at his Majority, or in caſe of his deceaſe to the Family of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> but what the performance will be, is not determinable, though he hath not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled to detain the like intruſive Guardianſhips in leſſer places, as we have mentioned in <hi>Wittenberg</hi> and <hi>Alſatia.</hi> As to the Revenue of this Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, it is computed worth ſome 35000 Crowns a year, amounting to 10000 ſterling; but the force of this Province no way available, for that it is every way encompaſſed with <hi>French</hi> Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and <hi>Avignion;</hi> ſo that in effect it is a diſtinct Soveraignty but as long as that King pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>Concerning the County of <hi>Avignion,</hi> It is ſeated to the Southward of <hi>Orange,</hi> and border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> as Neighbouring <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> and was given in fee to the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> (who had a right of Poſſeſſion before, and had alſo had an actual Poſſeſſion for ſome time) by Queen <hi>Joan</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> the rightfull Proprietor of this whole County of <hi>Province,</hi> for the defence
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:47448:54"/>and aſſiſtance ſhe had from <hi>Clement</hi> the 5th. in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtating her in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> whence ſhe had been expelled by <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>Hungary</hi> for her murtherous hanging of his Brother <hi>Andrew</hi> her Husband. Not long after, the ſame Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the Papal Chair thither, where it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for 20 years, while <hi>Italy</hi> was grown into ſo many factions, and the <hi>Romans</hi> and they ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted againſt the Pope, that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> found it high time to return in the year 1377. ſince when it hath been governed by Vice-Legates, till the year 1663. when the King of <hi>France</hi> took poſſeſſion of it, the manner whereof having been already publiſhed, 'twill be ſuperfluous here to repeat.</p>
               <p>But the Difference between the Pope and the <hi>French</hi> King concerning the affront given the Duke of <hi>Creque</hi> his Ambaſſadour at <hi>Rome</hi> being compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reconciled by the agreement at <hi>Piſa,</hi>

               <p>In the ſame Soveraign condition ſtood <hi>Bearn,</hi> till the time of <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13th. (an Eſtate governed diſtinctly by <hi>H.</hi> 4. their Soveraign, as united to the Crown of <hi>Navarre</hi> ſome Deſcents before) who, with his Armes, and his Preſence, reduced them under his Obedience: and impoſed a Parliament up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them of his own Nomination, whoſe Reſidence is at <hi>Pau,</hi> leaving them notwithſtanding the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Religion, as he did all the Proteſtant Towns, and Cautionary Places, <hi>viz.

               </p>
               <p>We have next to conſider the Revenue of this mighty Monarchy, mighty for its Populouſneſs and Chivalry, mighty for its large and compact
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:47448:55"/>Territory, as for its Fertility, and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of Conveyance from Province to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and for the In-land Fortreſſes, and of late ſuſpectful alſo for their Maritime Advancements, while other Princes ſlept, or regarded not that growing Miſchief; more potent alſo by many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Conqueſt of late years, ſince Fortune hath turned her ballance, and rejected the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard;</hi> ſo that the <hi>French</hi> King is abſolutely the greateſt Prince in the Continent of <hi>Europe:</hi> And he aſpires alſo now to the Sea, by his late Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of making Guilds and Companies for the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade, where ſcarce a Ship of his hath been ever ſeen Trading. But to return to his Revenue; In the year 1643. the Taxes and Tallages alone amounted to five Millions Sterling. The Impoſt of Salt amounts yearly to two Millions of Pounds Sterling, which is an inſuportable Burden upon the poor People, who are forced to take ſuch quantities yearly, more than they can uſe, at the Kings exceſſive Rates. It is true, that <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th. had once deſigned to buy all the Salt Pits in <hi>Poitou</hi> and <hi>Brittany,</hi> that were in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar mens hands, and to have fold the Salt at thoſe Places to the Merchants, at a Price he ſhould ſet, and they to ſell it over the Kingdom, as Corn is in the Market, without any Compulſion or Impoſt; by which means, twenty thouſand Officers would be ſpared, all which are paid at the Charge of the King: and the poor Subject ſhould have it four times cheaper than it is now ſold, and the King alſo put more Money in his Pocket, with-not any trouble.</p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:47448:55"/>
               <p>His next Revenue conſiſts in his Cuſtomes of all Merchandiſes, exported and imported, which aroſe in the year 1648. as by Computation was found, to the ſumm of ten Millions Sterling; and his Cuſtomes do not grow leſs, but greater every day: but of all this Revenue, ſcarce the tenth part comes and remains in the Kings Treaſury. Thus large is the Intrado or Income, and the Iſſue is but little narrower. The Kings Table ſtands him in 500000 <hi>l.</hi> yearly, beſides the Daulphins, and the Queens Expences of Court. The King hath every day nine Suits of Cloaths appointed to be made him, but the Money deſigned thereto, comes into the Lord Chamberlains Pocket, this King not affecting too frequent ſhift. Then in Penſions, and yearly Intereſt, there is paid ſeven Millions more; And for many years together, nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Armies have been maintained, although in ſuch Caſes the King extends his Prerogative, and takes what he pleaſeth: Not to mention his Sale of Offices, which amounts to very vaſt ſumms; (the Office of the Great Maſter of Artillery being worth 500000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling) nor his diſpoſal of Eccleſiaſtical Benefices, the right whereof is ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his, without the Popes intermedling in the leaſt; and the Clergy poſſeſs there no leſs than 30. Millions Sterling of yearly Rent.</p>
               <p>And becauſe we have here inſtanced his Armies, and touched before ſomething of the Force of this Kingdom, we will give a ſummary account of thoſe Forces he had on foot in 1662. to bring down the Diſcourſe to theſe modern times. Of Horſe, beſides 12. Comets of Foreigners, he
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47448:56"/>had in Pay 240. Troops, Cavaliers of his own Nation, which in all amounted to above 30. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand: Of Foot, he had 210. Regiments, ſome few of them of 30. Companies, and conſiſting of 90. Men in a Company; not reckoning in the <hi>Switzers,</hi> who make 6. or 7000. beſides ſome <hi>Scots, Iriſh, Italians,</hi> and <hi>Luyckers.</hi> At Sea, he had 30. Ships of War, and 25. Gallyes, and the number is now increaſed; and their Lord Great Admiral, the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> which was before a meer Titulado, with great Profit and Revenue, become an Officer <hi>de facto,</hi> and of great ſervice in that Kingdom: The Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> his Son, commanding the Fleet before <hi>Algier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King hath four Guards; the firſt of <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen, in Place and Attendance like our Gentlemen Penſioners, they are 200. in number, their Pay 20. Crowns a Month. The ſecond conſiſts of <hi>Scots,</hi> and they Gentlemen, ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on the Kings Perſon, others appointed to other Offices in the Court, and go alwayes armed either with the Halberd or Harquebuze; thoſe which attend on the Kings Perſon are 24. and receive yearly 400. Franks apiece, the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due 300. and a Livery. The third ſort is of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour <hi>French,</hi> and their Employment is ſuch as the ſervice of the Yeomen, and the Guard in <hi>England.</hi> The fourth conſiſteth of <hi>Switzers,</hi> and they wait at the Court Gate in warlike manner. This King retaineth the <hi>Switzers,</hi> more to diſ-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them from their Reſpects to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and that Families ſervice, than for any
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47448:56"/>other reaſon, though the long Correſpondence maintained with thoſe Cantons, hath abated of that jealouſie. Now notwithſtanding, for the number of the Gentry, which is infinite almoſt, the greatneſs of the Offices, goodlineſs of Towns, and multitudes of Forces, and ſtore of Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this Kingdom may ſeem to challenge Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence before any Court in <hi>Europe;</hi> yet for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of the Prince, Order of the Court, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Courtiers, and Entertainment of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, it may no way compare with that of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and this is not mine, but a Foreigners judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them Both.</p>
               <p>As to the Government, it is Monarchical to Exceſs; as it was ſaid of <hi>Caeſar, Voluntas</hi> Caeſaris <hi>pro Lege habebatur,</hi> ſo it is as true of the <hi>French</hi> Kings, <hi>Their Will is the Law;</hi> For though they have now nine Parliaments in the Kingdom, and that of <hi>Pau</hi> in <hi>Bern</hi> added by <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13th. yet are they no more ſuch a Conſtitution as Ours, than Our Late High Courts of Juſtice, which were Perſons pick'd for the Uſurpers purpoſe. The main work of theſe Parliaments is to ratifie the Kings Edicts, which are ſent to them with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that ſuch is <hi>Our Pleaſure:</hi> Nor doth this Ratification, when done, ſignifie any thing to the Validity of the Kings Acts, but is meerly for ſhew, and to perſonate that Authority, which was in the former Parliaments, even till the time of <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13th. By which means, the King impoſeth upon his Subjects what he liſts, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes that want of Patrimony, which is moſtly aliened, and is the great Blemiſh of this Crown,

               </p>
               <p>And for the better ſupport of this way of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the Nobility are moſt of them employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Offices and Commands; the whole Kingdom being divided into 12.

               <p>The Intereſt of this Crown is of late very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, and very cloſely carried; the late League with <hi>Spain</hi> ſeems to be zealouſly regarded; and many good words are given the Emperour of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and Friendſhip; Greater Reſpect was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver given, nor higher Profeſſions of Amity ever expreſſed towards the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> The Pope and He ſeem to be reconciled, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Friendſhip between them is now <hi>in Actu,</hi> by the Popes Performance of the Concluſion made at <hi>Piſa;</hi> for that Cardinal <hi>Chigi,</hi> the Popes Legate, for the greater ſolemnity of this Affair, is on his way with the Satisfaction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on: The Duke <hi>Crequy</hi> is ready to return to <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Pyramis is erected, in memory of the Fact of the <hi>Corſi;</hi> and <hi>Don Mario,</hi> the Popes Nephew, upon his departure: But when all this is done, no man conceives the Chriſtian

               <p>He hath lately made a motion in <hi>Germany</hi> about <hi>Colmar</hi> and <hi>Slecksladt,</hi> and it is ſuſpected, they are the light Trepidations of ſome greater Rupture thereabouts; for that the <hi>French</hi> have long aimed upon the Imperial Dignity, is obvious to every eye, and this Prince is ſuppoſed to be more ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly bent upon that deſign, than any of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors. He hath to the purpoſe baffled and terrified the Pope, the Emperours left hand, and ſcared him before hand; and for his right hand, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> beſides the Peace between them, he will not be remiſs in fomenting the War with <hi>Portugal.</hi> The Princes of the Empire therefore give him fair words, and will oblige him, by performing his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands about thoſe Towns. He is ſure of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> ſo long as he enterpriſeth not upon <hi>Italy,</hi> for then he would become a Morſel between his Grinders. As to the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> they do not care to ſee him there, but love him well enough in <hi>France.</hi> We neither ſuſpect nor dread this Riddle of Fate, nor ſhall want a Sword to ſolve it, if with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and any body elſe, he could make a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Cord of it; and ſo we leave him to the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Time.

                  <hi>SPAIN</hi> is defended towards <hi>France,</hi> on the North, with Confines ſtrengthened both by Nature and Art, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Natural Height of the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains, which ſeparate the one Country from the other; and by the Artificial Forts of <hi>Scialon, Parpignian,</hi> and <hi>Pampalone,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Navarre:</hi> on all other ſides it is encompaſs'd with the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean, and the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea. Its Empire is divided into four Parts or Members, but we ſhall mention one only here, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The Kingdomes of <hi>Spain.</hi> 2. The States of <hi>Italy, Sicily,</hi> &amp;c. And 3. <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> And 4. The Dominions of <hi>India. Spain</hi> is by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for the greater grace, divided into 15. Kingdomes, namely, <hi>Caſtile, Aragon, Murcia, Granada, Gallicia, Guypuſcoa, Biſcay, Oviedo, Leon, Corduba, Toledo, Navarre, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talonia, Majorca, Valentia,</hi> and laſtly <hi>Portugal:</hi> but it being wreſted from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominions, as it was formerly, and now is a diſtinct Soverain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we will treat of the other 14. together, and of that by it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The Country it ſelf is very barren, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider each part thereof by it ſelf alone, but all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47448:59"/>reduced together, it aboundeth, and is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſtored with all Neceſſaries, and is particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſhed with Minerals. It is not very Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, both by reaſon the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Man is not apt for Generation, being more hot than virile in his Luſt; and the Women are Mothers ſo young and early, that Nature is decayed in them before the half of their Teeming. And 2. Becauſe ſuch vaſt numbers have been drawn thence continually, to ſerve in the Wars, and to re-inforce Garriſons; as alſo, for that many of his Subjects do excerciſe Navigation, eſpecially in great numbers to the <hi>Indies;</hi> which is peopled, what it is, with <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> only, and the Natives, for they will not truſt other people on ſhore, they are ſo jealous of their wealth; nevertheleſs, the Country is by this means rid of all ſlothful home-livers.</p>
               <p>Moſt of thoſe Kingdoms above mentioned were conquered and won from the <hi>Moors,</hi> and the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement made by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabel,</hi> Kings of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Aragon;</hi> which two Kingdomes, with <hi>Leon,</hi> became united by their Marriage at this ſame time: And for <hi>Navarre,</hi> it was ſeized by the Policy and Valour of this <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand,</hi> as we ſhall ſpeak more at large of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the Title of the <hi>French</hi> King, and the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>NAVARRE</hi> is bounded on the Eaſt with the Principality of <hi>Bearn,</hi> (in the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi>) and acknowledging the ſame Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; on the Weſt with the River <hi>Iberus,</hi> which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides it from <hi>Caſtile;</hi> on the North by the <hi>Canta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brian</hi> Mountains, which part it from <hi>Guypuſcoa;</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:47448:60"/>and on the South with <hi>Aragon.</hi> It taketh up ſome parts of both ſides the <hi>Pyrences,</hi> but the ſixth part of it lyeth on the <hi>French</hi> ſide, and is very ſteril, it is called the <hi>Baſe</hi> or <hi>Low Navarre,</hi> which <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13th. united with <hi>Bearn,</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> Crown; the other being called the <hi>High Navarre,</hi> lyeth on the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſide, and is fertile, and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Trees.</p>
               <p>In the Reign of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Albret,</hi> who had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Catherine,</hi> Siſter and Heir of <hi>Francis,</hi> the laſt of the Houſe of <hi>Foix,</hi> Kings of <hi>Navarre, Ferdinand,</hi> the moſt Catholique King, who had Conquered the Kingdom of <hi>Granada</hi> from the <hi>Moors,</hi> and united the two Potent Kingdomes of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Aragon,</hi> to which all the other, but this, and <hi>Portugal,</hi> were one way or other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated; reſolved to add this alſo, and to compleat the Monarchy of <hi>Spain.</hi> Hereupon, in the year 1512. pretending a final and utter Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of the <hi>Moors,</hi> he raiſed an Army, and of a ſudden marched towards <hi>Navarre,</hi> demanding of them paſſage for his Army into <hi>France; Lewis</hi> the 12th. the King whereof, with all his Subjects, were then under Excommunication, the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner of which <hi>Ferdinand</hi> undertook to be, as his Succeſſors have done ever ſince; which being waved by K ng <hi>John,</hi> and his Queen, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately en red the Country, and without the ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a blow, reduced it; the <hi>French</hi> King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backward to the relief of it then, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards endeavouring with all his Power to recover it, when it was too late, being fortified and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Conquerour. Not long after, in 1556. by
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47448:60"/>
                  <hi>Joan</hi> the Daughter and Heir of Henry of <hi>Albret,</hi> this Title, with the ſixth part mentioned before, came to <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> Duke of <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> Father of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th. of <hi>France;</hi> but the deſign of regaining this his paternal Inheritance, (by reaſon of his tedious War for the <hi>French</hi> Crown) was to him alſo unfeaſible; but had he ſurvived that fatal ſtroke, given him by <hi>Ravilliac,</hi> no doubt he would have bid fair for this his juſt Right; to which his Succeſſors have ſuch an appetite, (as Patrimony is a great Magnetick) that in all Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with <hi>Spain</hi> ſince, they inſert <hi>a ſalvo jure,</hi> a ſaving of their Claim, Right and Title to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi> to be lawful for them to proſecute in an ordinary Courſe of Juſtice; but that Juſtice hath no Courts, nor have Princes Patience or Hope in the Brawles of Lawyers, or thoſe Decrees which cannot give Seizin and Delivery. A lucky oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for a re-ſurprize, is only worthy of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.</p>
               <p>The other Kingdomes taking up too much room and time in their Limitation and Deſcription, we will mention and comprize together, giving the Reader to underſtand, that <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Aragon</hi> are the moſt noble, as who have made all thoſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Greatneſs; and their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Titles were theſe; to <hi>Arragon</hi> belonged <hi>Sicily, Sardinia, Majorca, Valentia, Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, Navarre,</hi> and <hi>Naples:</hi> To <hi>Caſtile</hi> belonged <hi>Leon; Gallicia, Toledo, Murcia, Biſcay, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> becauſe Queen <hi>Iſabel</hi> furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Columbus.</hi> Nor was <hi>Navarre,</hi> when under its former Princes, far behind them in ſuch Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:47448:61"/>on the <hi>French</hi> ſide. Note we alſo, that the County of <hi>Roſſilluon,</hi> formerly a Member of the Kingdom of <hi>Majorca,</hi> is by the late general Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, together with the Viguery of <hi>Conflans,</hi> and part of the County of <hi>Cerdana,</hi> as is ſituate in the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains towards <hi>France,</hi> and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>Catalonia,</hi> aſſigned by the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> for ever, to whom it was long ſince pawned for 300000. Crowns, but remitted by <hi>Charles</hi> the 8th. of <hi>France,</hi> to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catholique, upon condition he ſhould not hinder him in the Conqueſt of <hi>Naples.</hi> By the ſame Treaty the <hi>French</hi> ſurrendred all his Garriſons and Places he had taken in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> excepting ſuch as ſhould be found to belong to the County of <hi>Cerdana</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid.</p>
               <p>Theſe 14. Kingdomes are governed by the ſame Court, or Imperial Laws, intermix'd with ſome Cuſtomes of the <hi>Goths,</hi> and ſome additional Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of their Kings, and the Government conſerved by Juſtice, impartially here executed, and the Inquiſition in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs; ſo that there is never like to be a War upon pretence of Reformation in this Kingdom. To give the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple their due, (whether it is, that that Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath awed them to it) they are very devout and zealous, and moſt Loyal to their Prince, whom they will ſpare no blood nor treaſure to aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, and of whom they never ſpeak without great reverence and honour, and in his ſervice, no men can poſſibly be more patient, or endure more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and hardneſs, than will they, even to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt and worſt of Extremity; and as faithful and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:47448:61"/>true they are to him, there having been few Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of all his Subjects, nor any Command or Truſt betrayed by any of them. Generally of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they are very grave and ſerious in all their Actions, and yet notwithſtanding ſo addicted to Pride, that they think all the World pittiful Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows and Fools, in compariſon of themſelves. In ſumm, they have effected great and noble things, <hi>viz.</hi> their Conqueſt over the <hi>Moors,</hi> and the <hi>New World,</hi> together with <hi>Philip</hi> the Second's Conqueſt or Poſſeſſion of <hi>Portugal:</hi> and they have failed of as great, <hi>viz.</hi> their Deſign upon <hi>England</hi> in 88. and in their Grand Project of an Univerſal Empire, which hath almoſt broke the Heart of this Monarchy.</p>
               <p>The Government is Abſolute and Royal, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſeveral qualities are handled in ſeveral Councils, and they are ſeven in number; which, that the King may be the better informed of all Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, they keep alwayes near about his Perſon, in ſeveral Chambers under one Roof; their Names are theſe, The Council of <hi>Spain.</hi> 2. Of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi> 3. Of <hi>Italy.</hi> 4. Of the <hi>Low Countries.</hi> 5. of War. 6. Of the Order of St. <hi>John.</hi> And 7. Of the Inquiſition. In theſe the ſlow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate Adviſoes of <hi>Fabim,</hi> rather than the prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitant Reſolutions of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> are received. In as much as may be, Innovations and change of ancient Cuſtomes are avoided, by which conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and their warineſs in their Actions, they do ſeldom commit any overſight, or fall into any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order or rupture at home. By this way of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, the King rangeth under his Obedience <hi>Caſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:47448:62"/>Arragons, Biſcayners, Flemings, Italians, Indians, Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> People utterly different in Laws, Cuſtomes, and Natures, as if they were all of one Nation, and all his natural Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>The ill Correſpondency that is alwayes amongſt thoſe Counſellours, who aemulate one anothers greatneſs, is the Cauſe of long Deliberations and Slackneſs in Matters of greateſt Importance; but all Matters once reſolved on in Council, paſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, with incredible and ſurpaſſing ſecrecy, as well thoſe of mean, as thoſe of the weightieſt Conſideration. Secrecy of all ſecuring every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and being indeed the true ſcope of all Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of State; for Deſignes as ſoon as they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken air are blaſted therewith.</p>
               <p>In this point, <hi>Philip</hi> the 2d. of <hi>Spain,</hi> the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt Prince of his time, was very tenacious, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many things with his own hand, which never came near his Secretaries, but were tranſmitted by himſelf uncopied (but what he took likewiſe himſelf) to his Expreſſes and Diſpatches. In his laſt Advice to his Son there are theſe words; <hi>Do not offend or anger the Secretaries, deliver them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes work of ſmall or great importance, and make proof of them rather by your Enemies than your Friends, lock your chief ſecrets in your own breaſt.</hi> In this Prince failed that high-flown Ambition, which had tormented his Father <hi>Charles</hi> and Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, during the whole courſe of their Reign, namely, the Conceit of an Univerſal Monarchy; nor did it dye with him, for having all his life ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died nothing more than the ruine of <hi>France</hi> by the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:47448:62"/>League, and his own Armes, he commended the purſute of the Deſign to his Son; having alſo a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before his death reſolved on another Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for <hi>England,</hi> having procured a more exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of its Havens, the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but his Succeſſor <hi>Philip</hi> the 3d. (for his Son <hi>Charles</hi> was murthered in the Inquiſition (as ſuſpected to favour the Proteſtants) by his own conſent) ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how the Treaſure was waſted, and his Fathers Credit engaged for divers vaſte Summs of Money, not fully paid to this day, but running on Intereſt, and diſcharged by degrees, reſolved to ſteer ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Courſe, and firſt made Peace with <hi>England,</hi> and then a Truce with the <hi>Dutch</hi> for 12. Years; and, as the greateſt Act of his Reign, utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the <hi>Moors,</hi> 1100000. being driven out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their former Expulſion by <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who, leſt the Country ſhould be diſpeopled, ſuffered ſuch as would turn Chriſtians to ſtay, but now the Inquiſition diſcovered them all for Hypocrites, and entitled the King to a brave Patrimony. This ſame <hi>Philip</hi> the 3d. was a great Stickler for the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> in the <hi>German</hi> War, newly begun with the Elector Palatine, at which time in 1621. he died, and his Son <hi>Philip</hi> the 4th. ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, with whom was that fruitleſs Treaty of the Marriage of the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and the Reſtitution of the Palatinate.</p>
               <p>This Prince hath been embroyled in the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> War all along againſt his Inclination, which is otherwiſe diſpoſed, for he loves quiet and pleaſure, and vacancy from thoſe troubles of Empire which afflict ambitious People; and it is
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47448:63"/>hoped therefore he will hearken, now in his old age, to a Compoſure with <hi>Portugal,</hi> from which he hath reaped more loſs and diſhonour, than the Kingdom can be worth to him. Beſides, there are ſome Reaſons of State, why the Army of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould be disbanded, and no Forces more than u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual kept on Foot, leſt the General make ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance in the Succeſſion, who hath the Clergy and the Souldiery on his ſide. However, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent nothing is more eagerly carried on, than the Preparations for this Campagnia; but what the iſſue will be, either Peace or Victory, time will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide.</p>
               <p>As to the Forces of this Kingdom, the ſame may be ſaid of them as of the Bees; <hi>Quae Regio in terris noſtri non plena laboris:</hi> There is no Nation in <hi>Europe,</hi> but the remote Northern Kingdomes, that have not felt the Puiſſance thereof; and it is well known, that in all ages, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> have been accounted one of the moſt Valorous Nations in the World. The <hi>French</hi> in nine Years were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued to the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoak, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> held out 200. and then too, the Fortune and Perſon of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> the Univerſal Conquerour, was requiſite to their Subjugation. They ſerve better on Foot than on Horſeback, although they have Horſes of excellent Courage, and better with the Harquebuze, than with any other Weapon. As concerning their Cavalry, it cannot be gain-ſaid, but that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gennet is the nobleſt Horſe in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> far excelling the Courſer of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> or the Horſe of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> ſo much eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the <hi>French;</hi> or the <hi>Frieſland</hi> Horſe, in ſo
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:47448:63"/>great requeſt with the <hi>Germans.</hi> And it ſhould ſeem, that Nature her ſelf hath armed this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in giving them the Iron Mines of <hi>Biskay, Guypuſcoa,</hi> and <hi>Medina,</hi> with the Temperatures of <hi>Bilbo, Toledo,</hi> &amp;c. To conclude, as to the number of the Forces aforeſaid, this Prince is of that Mightineſs and Reputation to this day, that, beſides his own Subjects, he is able to wage what numbers of Horſemen and Footmen of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Italian,</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Nations it pleaſeth him; beſides, his Noblemen are bound to bring ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Horſe into the Field, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members how the War was carried on in <hi>Catalonia, Portugal, Italy,</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries</hi> together, cannot but reſolve, that his Puiſſance is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable. At all times his Majeſty is likewiſe conſtrained to maintain a ſtrong <hi>Armada</hi> in theſe Seas, to ſafeguard the Navigation to the <hi>Indies;</hi> beſides 24. Gallies to guard the Coaſt from the <hi>Turks,</hi> the Charge whereof is a Million of Crowns. There are beſides 8000. praeſidiary Souldiers, and no more, in the Frontier, and Coaſt Towns of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Charge whereof I ſaw not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted.</p>
               <p>As to the Revenue of this Potentate, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Income thereof amounts to ſix Millions of Gold, or 11. Millions of Crowns yearly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of much is engaged for the Debts of the Crown, the reſt is ſpent in Charges of the Wars, the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Kings Houſhold, and in the Gallies furniſhed againſt the <hi>Barbary</hi> Pirates. To this may be added, as another ordinary Revenue, the two Millions of Crowns which he receives yearly of the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:47448:64"/>Clergy, together with the Commendams of vacant Praeſentations, and the praeferring to Benefices. The whole Revenues of the Clergy are valued at ſix Millions of Gold yearly Rent, there being 34. Cathedral Churches, all richly endowed, ſome whereof having 50. ſome a 100. and ſome 200. Millions of yearly Revenue, and in particular, the Metropolitan Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Toledo</hi> hath more than 300. Millions: Neither do the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> care to parcel theſe Churches to a greater number, although over-grown with their plenty, for then they ſhould with more difficulty make uſe of the Revenues and Notes thereof, when occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on required, which is very often, upon any diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Event. As he likewiſe layes extraordinary Taxes upon the Laity in the like Occurrence, for in the Kingdom of <hi>Caſtile</hi> alone, <hi>Philip</hi> the 2d. had nigh 8. Millions of Gold in one year; reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hereto alſo the Profits which his Orders of Knighthood yield him, <hi>viz.</hi> 200. Millions of Crowns; ſo that here is Revenue more than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, were it not for the Canker of Intereſt at the Bank of <hi>Genoa,</hi> nor are the Merchants of <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp</hi> without their ſhare in the partition thereof; and now the <hi>Amſterdammers</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>This Princes Coyn notwithſtanding is the beſt in <hi>Europe,</hi> ſince all their Neighbours make a gain of them, as a Piece of Reals, or 8. Six-Pences in our Money, goeth in <hi>France</hi> for 4 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>6.</hi> a Doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin in Gold, that which is a Piſtolet with them, being 13. Shillings, is in <hi>France,</hi> and other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, 29. Reals, which is 14 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> of our Money. Moſt of the Coyn that paſſeth for Wine, Bread,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:47448:64"/>Fruit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is of Braſs, which they call Quartas, and Quartillas; of their Maravedies, 20. make three-pence; but ſometime the King enhanceth the Price of this Braſs Money of a ſudden, and with a great deal of profit to himſelf, brings a great loſs upon Trade. All their Meat, Fruit and Bread, are ſold by the Pound, and not except before an Officer, which they call <hi>Alcalda,</hi> ſo that no Stranger can be deceived in price or weight.</p>
               <p>As to the Intereſt of theſe Princes, it hath been evidently ſeen what it hath been; but ſince the <hi>French</hi> mated them under <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, and held them to it, till <hi>Lewis</hi> the 14th. was too powerful for them; ſince the <hi>Dutch</hi> baffled them, and We triumphed over them, they have been put to defend their own, inſtead of over-running others. Their Deſignes are now to ſecure their Eſtates, and to draw from them that Revenue into their Coffers, which was ſquandred away in the War, without any account; and yet to be as gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a Soveraign as poſſible. For all the late League, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> nor <hi>French</hi> will ever joyn Intereſts, or agree together, more than they do in their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours or Faſhions. In fine, they really hate one another, but more revengefully the <hi>Spaniard</hi> frets at the <hi>French,</hi> as he that firſt put a ſtop to his Career of Ambition; and therefore there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Jealouſie and Suſpition between them, however ſmoothed and oyled over with Court Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices, alike underſtood for ſuch on both ſides; nor have their late frequent Conſanguinities and Marriages any influences to draw them nearer to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny amicable underſtanding.</p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:47448:65"/>
               <p>With the <hi>Dutch</hi> he firmly keeps a good Correſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pondence, as his very good Friends, ſince Fate would needs have it ſo, and uſeth them very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfully, as his good Neighbours, and as ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to his Eſtates in <hi>Flanders;</hi> for the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as was ſaid, do not love the <hi>Frenchmens</hi> vicinity. For the King of <hi>England,</hi> he cheriſheth a more than uſual reſpect, teſtified by thoſe publique Honours done his Ambaſſador Sr. <hi>Richard Fanſhaw</hi> in that Kingdom, and inviolably obſerveth the Peace betwixt us. With the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> he is newly reconciled, and certainly that Duke (who hath the Citadel of <hi>Verceil</hi> reſtored him by this King, by vertue of the late Treaty) hath no great Antipathy againſt Him, for he hath ſuffered twice more from the <hi>French,</hi> than from the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who is as well able to Defend Him, as he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently ſcited to Offend him upon every diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> is allyed to him, and ſo ſure to his Intereſt. The <hi>Florentine</hi> is ſtiff, but is aequal between the <hi>French</hi> and Him. The <hi>Mantuan</hi> will be Neutral; and the Pope his ſecret Friend. The Prince of <hi>Modena</hi> will hardly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage any more againſt Him, for in a manner he is the Umpire of all Quarrells between thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. He is Patron alſo to the Common-Wealth of <hi>Luca.</hi> And for the States of <hi>Venice,</hi> ever ſince the Dutchy of <hi>Millain</hi> came to the poſſeſſion of this Crown, they have ſet them down with great quietneſs, rather looking to the ſtrengthening of their own, than attempting his; and good reaſon too, for our Anceſtors have ſeen the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> favouring the <hi>Venetians,</hi> (when their Eſtate was
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47448:65"/>dangerouſly hazarded by the <hi>Turk</hi>) chearfully to have entred into the Actions of <hi>Cephalonia</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panto,</hi> when nevertheleſs at the ſame inſtant they had at their own Doors <hi>Algier, Tunis,</hi> and other <hi>African</hi> Ports, their dangerous Enemies. The State of <hi>Genoa</hi> muſt favour the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſtand by him, for he is their Protector, and owes them vaſt ſumms, which by any partiality of their ſide will be wholly loſt. With all the Catholique Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> he is in perfect Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and how great a relation and neceſſity of mutual adhaerence there is between the Emperour and Him, no man is ignorant, confirmed now, and more intimately contracted by the late Marriage of the Infanta. With the King of <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morocco</hi> his Catholique Majeſty is in League, but it is of no uſe or availment to him. Of the Religion of <hi>Malta</hi> the King taketh a particular protection, as that in like ſort depends wholly upon his pleaſure, and doth readily execute his Royal Commandements, ſerving him often in keeping the Coaſts of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Kingdomes of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> from Incurſions of Pyrates, and that without one penny coſt or charges to the King.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Turk,</hi> he maintains no intercourſe, nor uſeth any Trade with him, and yet he hath neither Peace nor War with him; Peace he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends he ought not to have, and the other he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not for; and the <hi>Turk</hi> is as unwilling to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel as he, remembring what he ſuffered from him at <hi>Lepanto:</hi> So that pivate Damages are privately made good, and the <hi>Algier</hi> men do take upon themſelves the Rupture, if any louder Miſchief
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:47448:66"/>happen, of which the <hi>Spaniard</hi> will not complain. It is thought that this King is Superiour to the <hi>Turk</hi> in Naval Furniture and Proviſion, and the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Ability of Seamen, for his <hi>Biskayners</hi> and <hi>Catalonians</hi> are hardly to be paralleled for enduring of Winter weather and Tempeſts: and the <hi>Turk</hi> is alwayes moared at home from <hi>October</hi> to <hi>March;</hi> beſides the convenience of his Coaſt for building of Ships and Gallies, of which he hath a 100. in readineſs: and the <hi>Turk</hi> hath but two Places all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long his <hi>African</hi> Coaſt, <hi>viz. Algier</hi> and <hi>Tunis,</hi> where he can build a Veſſel.</p>
               <p>Upon this account it was, that <hi>Philip</hi> the 2d. was adviſed to ſeize upon the <hi>Morea</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> thoſe People being willing to embrace a Chriſtian Defender againſt that unſupportable ſlavery which they ſuffer from the <hi>Turk;</hi> but he conſidering his Fathers ill ſucceſs in <hi>Africa,</hi> (though aſcribable more to Tempeſt, than to any other Cauſe) would never caſt his eye upon that Enterprize, being bent upon far worſe, to the diſturbance of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom;</hi> ſo that it appears, he is the only Prince, that is able to give him a Potent Diverſion, were not his Fleets otherwiſe employed.</p>
               <p>But withall, this King at preſent is ſo exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he is not in a Capacity to undertake ſuch an Expedition, without the aſſiſtance of other Chriſtian Princes, which the <hi>Venetians</hi> have a long while in vain implored, and he cannot hope to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it till the danger is more eminent, and then hee'l find wayes to defend himſelf: This may be certainly concluded on, he will do what in him ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, to keep the <hi>Turk</hi> from ſwallowing the Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:47448:66"/>Countries of the Emperour, in which he hath an Expectation and Reverſion, and will ſpare him ſuch Supplies, however he pincheth for it, as ſhall teſtifie his Zeal, Affection and Care for the Imperial Family: And ſo having finiſhed this ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of <hi>Spain,</hi> we will next take a ſhort view of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall.</hi>

               <p>INto this Kingdom of <hi>Portugall</hi> are reckoned, as in <hi>Spain,</hi> two other Kingdomes, ſo teeming are theſe little Soveraignties of other Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, namely, the Kingdom of <hi>Algarve,</hi> and that of the Iſles of the <hi>Azores,</hi> or the <hi>Terceras. Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall</hi> is bounded on the North with two Rivers, which part it from <hi>Gallicia;</hi> on the South with <hi>Algarve,</hi> on the Weſt with the <hi>Atlantique</hi> Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; and on the Eaſt with the new and old <hi>Caſtile.</hi> Extended on the Sea Coaſt from North to South, reckoning in the Kingdom of <hi>Algarve,</hi> 400. Miles; in breadth not exceeding a 100. and in ſome places not 80. and 60. The Country is very deſtitute and unprovided of Corn, but that ſupplyed by Wine, Oyl, Figgs, and other Fruits; as for Cattel, they have no ſtore, nor have they much
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:47448:67"/>uſe of them, as in <hi>Spain,</hi> the People being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hot and dry, and delighting in Fruits and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads, as cooling and ſatisfying alſo.</p>
               <p>This Kingdom is now governed by <hi>Alphonſo</hi> the 6th: (who hath a Brother, a very hopeful Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, named <hi>Don Pedro</hi>) of the Houſe of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganza,</hi> whoſe Claim againſt <hi>Philip</hi> the 2d. (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended of <hi>Mary,</hi> fifth Daughter of <hi>Emanuel</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> but immediate ſurviving Heir to <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> her Brother, (third Son of <hi>Emanuel</hi>) Cardinal and King of <hi>Portugall</hi>) was judged loſt when the Crown came into his Fathers Poſſeſſion, for that his Anceſtor had married <hi>Katherine,</hi> the Daughter of Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> fourth Son of <hi>Emanuel,</hi> who dyed indeed before his Brother the Cardinal King <hi>Henry.</hi> It is true, the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Mary</hi> her elder Siſter, but againſt that the <hi>Civilians</hi> alleged, that the Crown, by a peculiar Law of that Kingdom, paſſed in ſuch Caſes to ſuch Heirs as were Natives of the Realm: However the Title was, the People were reſolved the Houſe of <hi>Braganza</hi> ſhould have the Crown, which was wonderfully accompliſh'd in 1640. and of which we will diſcourſe no further.</p>
               <p>This Crown hath had wonderful Succeſſes, both in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> where they have wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Braſile</hi> from the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> and at Home alſo; for though they be but a handful of People, yet by immuring themſelves in ſuch ſtrong Places, as they took by Shipping and Naval Sieges from the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> and venturing in all weathers to relieve one another, to the diſappointment of their Enemies, who thought by Sieges at Land to recover the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:47448:67"/>they had loſt by the opportunity of ſuch tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous ſeaſons, they have fixed themſelves ſo in thoſe <hi>Indies,</hi> that they command a great part thereof, and the beſt alſo, till by our Aſſiſtance, ſome forty Years agoe, the <hi>Perſian</hi> recovered <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> the notedſt Place of Trade then in the Eaſt; and in defence whereof, they defeated two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who hath his City and Port of <hi>Aden</hi> in the ſame Sea; but now the <hi>Turk</hi> and they have done, and the <hi>Perſian</hi> is in their room.</p>
               <p>At Home he is engaged againſt the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but the War hath proved ſo fortunate to him, that he hath rather got than loſt by it; however, it is hoped it will be compoſed by a Peace, although there are ſeveral Intereſts which do with-hold it all they can. The <hi>French</hi> deſerted them by the late general Treaty, but it is conceived they would ſtick as cloſe to them now. The <hi>Dutch</hi> do no way care that the <hi>Portugalls</hi> ſhould have Peace at home, for their fingers itch at <hi>Braſile,</hi> and they have been long quarrelling about it for Damages, but they are in fear of Seconds; beſides that, they are now in proſecution of a War in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> where alſo they have had ſome Succeſſes. It concerns Us, that the King of <hi>Portugall,</hi> our chief Ally, ſhould be advanced to a Condition of Proſperity and Grandeur, and no wayes will be omitted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing thereunto. With other Princes and States this Kingdom hath not to do, ſave with the Pope, who hath at laſt promiſed the Confirmation of all Eccleſiaſtical Preferments, and the Biſhops other Clergy in that Kingdom: Unleſs with ſome of the

               <p>The Force of this Kingdom is not very great, the Commanders finding much adoe to bring 20000. Effectif Men into the Field againſt the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> nor are thoſe well provided or harneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; but ſuch hath been their reſolution and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity againſt their old Enemy the <hi>Caſtilians,</hi> that they have generally carried away the <hi>Victory;</hi> and what <hi>Wings</hi> We have added to <hi>Her,</hi> Fame hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready told the World. As the Force but the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> of this Kingdom is little conſiderable, ſo is the Revenue, ſaving that the Patrimony of this Prince is of great value, and yearly Intrado, for, as Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> he poſſeſſeth more than one third of the Kingdom, and there is a little belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Crown. The reſt of his Revenues come by his Cuſtomes, with this he maintains ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Store-houſes all along the Country, a dayes march commonly from one another, for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of the marching Army, and the relief of the ſick or travelling Souldiers with Paſſes; as he doth Ships of War for ſecurity of his Trade, that of Sugar bringing him in exceeding great Profit.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Turk,</hi> he hath no leiſure to look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, nor is he accommodated with Ships or Naval Apparel to engage him, His Navy conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:47448:68"/>chiefly of great and ſlow Gallions, built for Burden, and Defence, and againſt ſwelling Seas, and for other Coaſts, and the great deep Ocean, ſo that they would ſoon periſh in the windings of the <hi>Mediterranean;</hi> and therefore we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him as any Help againſt the Common Enemy, but muſt look upon his Quarrel as fatal to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Cauſe; and therefore we ſhould pray, that it would pleaſe God, maugre all Oppoſition, ſpeedily to reconcile it: And ſo we paſs through the <hi>Alps</hi> to the States of <hi>Italy.</hi>

                  <hi>GENEVA</hi> is an Imperial City in <hi>Savoy,</hi> ſituated at the South end of the Lake <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannus,</hi> upon the brink of the ſaid Lake. It is in circuit about 2. <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles, very ſtrong both by Nature and Art, as well for that it is ſeated on a Hill, which on the Weſt is not eaſily acceſſible, as alſo for that it is exceedingly well fortified with Ravelings, Bulwarks, and Platforms, beſides a deep Ditch, the Eaſt and Weſt parts thereof ſtanding continually full of water, the South part remains dry continually, and is well defended with Caſemates, the better to ſcour the Curtayn.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:47448:69"/>The Town is ſo much the ſtronger, for that it tandeth almoſt in an Iſland, having the Lake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid on the North, the River <hi>Rhoſne</hi> upon the Weſt, and the River of <hi>Arba</hi> upon the South, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Town half a mile, and by reaſon of the ſwiftneſs of the Current, and great moveable Stones in the bottom, which are violently carried down, the River is not paſſable, but with great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>The River <hi>Rhoſne</hi> divideth the Town into 2. parts, the one is called the <hi>High Town,</hi> and the other St. <hi>Gervais.</hi> It is well peopled, ſome 20000. of all ſorts. Their Territories are ſmall, being no way above 2. Leagues and a half, yet by reaſon the ſoyl is fruitful, being well manured, it bringeth Grain of all ſorts, and good ſtore of Wine. There are likewiſe many paſture and feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grounds, by means whereof the Inhabitants are well provided of all ſorts of good Fleſh, at a reaſonable rate; no want of good Butter and Cheeſe; and of wild-Foul, as Partridge, Quayl, Mallard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There are alſo excellent Fruits, the rareſt Pear-mains in the World; and the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and the Lake, afford all manner of freſh Fiſh, as Carp, Tench, Roach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But above all, the biggeſt Carps in <hi>Europe.</hi> Beſides, they are ſerved out of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Country, and the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton of <hi>Bearn,</hi> by the Peaſants of each, for that ready Money cannot be had elſe-where. It ſtandeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo convenient for, and doth exerciſe Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, being the ordinary tranſport of Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties out of <hi>Germany</hi> to <hi>Lions,</hi> and ſo into <hi>France,</hi> and back again; by which means the Inhabitants
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:47448:69"/>are grown very rich: As alſo, for that the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyards,</hi> and the ſaid People of <hi>Bearn,</hi> do reſort hither to buy their Armour, Apparel, and other Neceſſaries, the Citizens being for the moſt part Mechanicks, and making excellent Muskets, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As alſo Satin, Velvet, and Taffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though not ſo good as that of <hi>Italy.</hi> The Merchants that are here, are generally rich, and of great Eſtates.</p>
               <p>The Revenue of this Town is ſome 100000. Crowns, which ariſeth out of the Gabels of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe, Fleſh, their Demayn, and Tithes, which is conſerved in the common Treaſury, and iſſued out thence to publick uſes. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> pretends a Title to this Town, as governed before the Reformation by a Catholique Biſhop, who being Lord thereof, as his temporal Eſtate, did homage for it to the ſaid Duke; that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney the Biſhop coyned bore his Inſcription; that the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> had alwayes an Office there, without acquaintance of which no ſentence of Law could be executed; that the power of pardoning Offenders remained in the ſaid Dukes. But the <hi>Genevois</hi> turn a deaf Ear to thoſe Pretenſions, but do therefore bear him a perpetual grudge, and hate him worſe than all their Neighbours; nor do they much fear him, for neither the <hi>French,</hi> nor <hi>Spaniard,</hi> nor any of the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> will ſuffer him, or he, or they ſuffer one another, to poſſeſs themſelves of this ſtrong, commodious, and moſt convenient Fortreſs. Inſomuch, that when any Deſign hath been formed againſt them, they have had timely notice thereof, beſides Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47448:70"/>to provide themſelves with neceſſaries; but ſuch is the careful Government of the place, that there is alwayes 6. Months Proviſion in the Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, and of Men and Munition they have enow within the Town; no leſs than 20. Guns being mounted on their Bulwarks, beſides what they have in their Arſenal, wherein are 10. or 12.

Muskets, lodged in the ſame Arſenal; they can alſo raiſe and maintain 2000. Men.</p>
               <p>The Town is governed by a Council of 200. called the <hi>Great Council,</hi> out of which is choſen another Council, compoſed of five and twenty, and out of theſe 4. eſpecial Men, whom, by a <hi>Greek</hi> term, they call <hi>Syndiques,</hi> that is, Co-Judges, who have the managing of the whole Common-wealth, unleſs it be in ſome great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, wherein the whole State is concerned, as in making of Peace or War, Leagues offenſive and defenſive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then the whole Council is aſſembled. They are governed by the Civil Law, as generally the <hi>Germans</hi> are, the Judge whereof is called a <hi>Lieutenant Criminal,</hi> before whom all Cauſes are tried, and from whom lyes no appeal, but to the Council of two hundred. They allow no refuge to any Offenders of other Countries, but puniſh them as they ſhould have been in the place where the Crime was committed.</p>
               <p>I have been the more prolix in deſcribing the Military and Secular Government, with the ſite and ſtrength of the Place, becauſe this is the <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladium</hi>

               <p>It is for certain, the Receptacle of divers <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Tranſports, who will, or now can comply with the <hi>Geneva,</hi> though not with the <hi>London</hi> Presbytery, forſooth it is here in purity, and hath not contracted the Pride and Covetouſneſs of our Rabbies. But among the reſt, here is that <hi>Illuſtrious Nothing,</hi> or at leaſt here he was not long ſince, who was knaved into, and was fooled out of, his ridiculous Uſurpation in <hi>England,</hi> I mean <hi>Richard Cromwell,</hi> the eldeſt Son of the late <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;</hi> the Town he gueſſed could not but be civil to him, for the great Expence his Fathers 3. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, Mr. <hi>Pel.</hi> &amp;c. made here about the Compoſition of the <hi>Piedmont</hi> Troubles, and out of reſpect to the Moneys which was depoſited in their hands. How he lived here is not diſcovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for privacy hath enveloped the fond Glories of this ſhort reign'd Uſurper, and obſcurity is the beſt foyl to this once glittering Pibble; but enough of this example to ambitious wretches.</p>
               <p>And here out of hand is to be formed, as it was moſt ingenuouſly and aptly repreſented, a huge Army, in aid and aſſiſtance of the <hi>Turk,</hi> who will publiquely profeſs the Religion hereof, as agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſt with that Tyrannical Goverment. But to proceed.</p>
               <p>This Religion was introduced by <hi>Calvin,</hi> 1541. the ſumm whereof was this, <hi>viz.</hi> All Miniſters to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47448:71"/>be equally great amongſt themſelves. 2. Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men out of the People to be joyned unto every Miniſter, and theſe were called <hi>Elders;</hi> the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to continue for term of Life in this power, but the Elders to be choſen every year, which was very grateful to the Burgers, who hoped each of them to come to the Adminiſtration of the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Authority; theſe, together with other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Elders, being met together, to be called the Presbytery, and to have power of Ordination, Excommunication, and Abſolution, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe was done by their Biſhop in times before, whom he made the <hi>Genevois</hi> utterly to abjure, and to receve this Platform as ſent from Heaven. But — Nevertheleſs the People did not long like it; but <hi>Calvin,</hi> by his Authority, and the awe of the Canton of <hi>Zurich,</hi> kept it rigidly up, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his life time; after which, the ſucceeding Miniſters allowed the People the uſe of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Exerciſes in the Morning, and intervalls of Divine Service, which ſomething mitigated the Humour, and, like the <hi>Roman</hi> Sports, took them off from quarrelling with their Miniſters.</p>
               <p>What they are like to do againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> the Paſſage above-mentioned declares; 'twas <hi>Luther</hi> that gave admittance, I mean his Reformation, to the <hi>Turk</hi> to invade <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> that is to ſay, he took advantage of thoſe Diviſions that reigned then; and it may be now ſaid, that the troubles in the <hi>Roman</hi> temporal Eſtate, have engaged him, which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> lay all upon the Heretique, ſo that it comes to this Door at laſt, or they will leave it there. In fine, They are able to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:47448:71"/>and are the only Snayls in <hi>Europe.</hi> They are confederate with the Canton of <hi>Bearn,</hi> but 'tis for their ſecurity.</p>

               <p>IN our paſſage from <hi>Geneva</hi> to the <hi>Switzers,</hi> lyeth a Country called <hi>Walliſland,</hi> governed by a Catholick Biſhop, and leagued with the 7. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Cantons: They are divided into 7. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts, and 2. Diſtricts or Provinces; the lower, and the upper; they lye included betwixt Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, out of which they ſeldom iſſue, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we bid adieu to them, and make way to their Neighbours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SWITZERLAND</hi> is bounded on the Weſt with Mount <hi>Jour,</hi> and Lake <hi>Leman;</hi> on the North with <hi>Swevia</hi> in <hi>Germany;</hi> on the South with <hi>Walliſland,</hi> and the <hi>Alps;</hi> and on the Eaſt with the <hi>Griſons,</hi> and part of <hi>Tirol</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi> It is reported to ſtand upon the higheſt ground in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> yet hath it plenty of Rivers, which it diſpenſeth in the greateſt Chanels through the mightieſt Provinces of <hi>Europe.</hi> It hath many Lakes, and abundance of freſh, and excellent good Fiſh, by which Lakes and Rivers there is
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:47448:72"/>good paſſage and conveyance; there are alſo Medows, as pleaſant, and as eminent for their fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility, as their Mountains are prominent, rough and ſterile. The whole Country contains in length 240. Miles, and in bredth 180. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple rude and Military, as all Mountainers uſe to be.</p>
               <p>They were once under the Government of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> as Earls of <hi>Halspurg,</hi> the Caſtle whereof is ſtanding in this Country, which gave Original and Title to that Family, but riſing for their Liberty, provoked by the Rape of one of their Daughters, they, by 2. terrible Defeats given the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> ſhook off their Yoak; and immediately 3. Cantons combined in a League, with which, after ſome Ages or Years, all the 13. entred, and in which they now continue. The firſt thing they did in the beginning of this Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy, was to root out all the Gentry, and not leave a remain of them, as thoſe that were the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of their ſlavery under the <hi>Auſtrians:</hi> So that no man there pretends to be gentilely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, for thereby he is made uncapable of any Office in the Common-wealth; yet there are ſome noble Spirits, that prefer their blood to ſuch ſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Magiſtracies, where the Butcher, and the Shooe maker takes his turn in the Government, and is in his Town the ſupreme Ruler, and to this module they yet keep.</p>
               <p>Their Exemption of themſelves in this manner from the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> made them notable in the World, which they were not ſince <hi>Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar;</hi> but their defeat and ſlaughter of <hi>Charles</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:47448:72"/>Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and their renue for the Duke of <hi>Millain</hi> againſt the <hi>French,</hi> made them terrible and famous; until finding their own ſtrength, they began to play faſt and looſe with their Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, and to become open Mercenaries, loſing <hi>Millain,</hi> which they had preſerved, and ſerving the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King, the <hi>Venetian,</hi> and others, at the ſame time, under certain ſecret Penſions, which the chief Counſellours do receive at this day; ſo that all the Honour that is left them (which they might have blazoned by many Conqueſts upon their Neighbours) is borrowed from their attendance as Guards to the Perſon of the <hi>French</hi> King; and Sedan-men, or ſome ſuch Office about the Pope. Nevertheleſs, it is to be confeſſed, that they are very good Infantry, and will ſtand a ſhock firm, and in good order, which is a main ſecurity to the <hi>French</hi> Foot, that can hardly endure an eaſie impreſſion.</p>
               <p>Their Government at home is divided into 3. Members: 1. The 13. Cantons, being 7. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and 6. Proteſtant. 2. The States and Cities confederate, as the Abbot of St. <hi>Gall, Multiuſe,</hi> a free City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And laſtly, The Praefectures, or ſeveral Lordſhips and Towns, which they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs in the <hi>Alps,</hi> in the Dutchy of <hi>Millain,</hi> &amp;c. which are a diſtinct part of the Common-wealth, but are ſubject to the Cantons, and obey their Decrees (without any Vote in their Councils) as Subjects; and of theſe Towns and Lordſhips they have ſome number, which yields the beſt of their Revenue. The Regiment or Magiſtracy is altogether Popular, and conſiſts in a Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:47448:73"/>ſummoned upon any great and emergent Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; and yet the particular Cities, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts, or Hundreds, in number 148. are govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by one Officer. So hath every Canton a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Maſtiſtrate, called the <hi>Ungman,</hi> or ſingle Perſon, who is aſſiſted with a Council in Caſes of Importance. The Diets are held commonly at <hi>Baden,</hi> for the beauty and commodiouſneſs of the Place, where all things concerning Peace and War, Embaſſies, Leagues, and the like, are alwayes determined.</p>
               <p>Their Revenue is very inconſiderable, for having no Commerce with Strangers, they have no Cuſtomes, nor have they any Manufactures. Cutlery is a great Trade. What they raiſe is by Impoſt upon Wine, and thoſe Taxes laid upon their Prefectures, whom yet they uſe very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly; beſides, the yearly Penſions they receive from the Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> are brought into the publick Treaſury, ſave what comes pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately into the hands of the Grandees, and thoſe that manage the State, one of the greateſt ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes and prejudices to their State; but as 'tis no ſhame to be mercenary in the Field, ſo 'tis no blame to be a Mercenary in Council.</p>
               <p>As to their Force, it far excceds their Revenue, for upon occaſion, they can bring 30. thouſand Foot into the Field, beſides what the confederate Cities will add thereunto: As for Horſe, they are of no uſe in thoſe hilly Countries, nor a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the number of the Foot, to defend a Region ſo impregnable; and they have no ambition, as we have mentioned before, of invading others.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:47448:73"/>And if there ſhould happen a Diviſion, and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel ſhould ariſe betwixt the Cantons, as lately there did, and that to Armes, ſuch Forces are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requiſite as may oppoſe the numbers of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Party, for they cannot march in great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and, as I remember, there were not 3000. Men engaged on either ſide in the late Difference; Fights are there by hundreds, and twenties, for few more have room to combat.</p>
               <p>But what they want at home, they have in the wide World; they are now in the ſervice of the <hi>French, Venetian, Spaniard,</hi> and <hi>Genoiſe,</hi> whoſe Dukes Guards likewiſe they are; and they are raiſing 6000. more Foot for the <hi>Spaniard</hi> againſt the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> among the Catholique Cantons, if the late Broyl do not hinder the Levy. But not a word all this while of any Forces for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, ſo true is their uſual Proverb; — <hi>Non point L'argent, non point</hi> Swiſſe, No Money, no <hi>Swiſſe;</hi> beſides they no way affect the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria:</hi> and their late ſolemn Embaſſy of 30. of their Sages, and their no leſs magnificent recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>France,</hi> with more Ceremony and Punctilios than was ever uſed towards them before, doth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue ſome Intrigue that way, but what Time muſt be tell troth; nor care for his ſervice, or regard his diſtreſſes; what ever betides him, they are ſecure by their Mountains; and there we muſt leave them, for the <hi>Turk,</hi> if Victorious, to look up to.</p>

               <p>THis Noble Dutchy of <hi>Savoy</hi> is another, and the principal Member of theſe States of the <hi>Alps,</hi> and though we have not given it praece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in this Tranſition, yet it juſtly claimes it, but our deſign was to mention it in our way to <hi>Italy,</hi> and to place it before that moſt excellent Region, and thoſe Soveraignties and Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which better aſpect it, than the uncouch rudeneſſes of thoſe Mountainous Common-wealths.</p>
               <p>It is bounded on the Weſt with <hi>Daulphine;</hi> on the South with <hi>Province,</hi> and the <hi>Mediterranean;</hi> on the Eaſt with <hi>Millain</hi> and <hi>Montferrat;</hi> on the North with <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and the Lake <hi>Leman;</hi> and is divided into 2. Members, <hi>Savoy,</hi> properly ſo called, and <hi>Piedmont;</hi> the later of theſe is the moſt noble, as wherein ſtands <hi>Turin,</hi> the Dukes Reſidence, and wherein are abundance of Marqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſates, and other noble Titles, and their Manſions, a number of Towns, and as well built and fortified,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:47448:75"/>but better peopled; famous alſo for the Valley of <hi>Aſt,</hi> and for one of the ſtrongeſt Fortifications in the World, <hi>viz. Nizze,</hi> a Sea-Port, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it had any Walls finiſhed, baffled and baulked the famous <hi>Turkiſh Barbaroſſa,</hi> called in by the <hi>French</hi> King, againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the 5th. with 200.

The vulgar <hi>Savoyards</hi> are naturally ſtupid, and no way given to Military affairs, but the Gentlemen of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Addreſs, as are the Citizens, and many of the middle ſort.</p>
               <p>This Duke is indeed Maſter of a fine Country, and a good People; the Country of a large extent, and the people of a large Heart and Liberal Hand to their Prince, when upon occaſion he demands ſupplies, eſpecially the <hi>Piedmonteſe;</hi> for beſides his ordinary revenue, which ſome have reckoned at 400000 <hi>l. ſterling,</hi> he uſually doubles it by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions upon his Subjects, if he increaſes it not beyond that proportion.</p>
               <p>And he had need of a good Revenue; for he hath a number of Garriſons, both Frontire, Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and Maritime to maintain, out of which in Field ſervice he is forced to draw his Army, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he is ſerved voluntarily by the Gentry, who with their retinnue and attendants do furniſh out his Troops. This Prince aſſumes to himſelf the ſtyle and title of his <hi>Royal Highneſs,</hi> as King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and will have his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours treated as the Miniſters of <hi>a Teste Couronne,</hi> and to be placed and received like them, which hath of late times been admitted in moſt Courts of <hi>Europe,</hi> although ſcrupled by the <hi>Venetian, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>As to his Intereſt in the World, he appears very conſiderable, both the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> willing to be his Friend, and his Concern is to be neutral to them both, as his mighty and potent Neighbours on both ſides his Dominions; He ſided in this laſt War with the <hi>French,</hi> but 'twas by reaſon of his marriage with <hi>Christiana,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King's Siſter; as when coupled with <hi>Spain,</hi> he engaged there: But formerly theſe Dukes were conſtant Sticklers for the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> but it is judged that the <hi>French</hi> Friendſhip is more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and ſafe for this Dutchy, not only by the Event of the late War, whereby he hath all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored him in the general Treaty: but alſo as to the preſent Juncture, and the likely aſpect of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Affairs: But to proceed.</p>
               <p>This Duke is challenged as a Feudatory and Feif of the Empire, but he cannot of late be drawn to acknowledge it, although <hi>Charles</hi> the 5th. rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtated one of theſe Dukes, after he was deſpoyled in his quarrel by the <hi>French</hi> King; and though it is alleged, they were firſt inveſted by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in theſe Dominions, and upon this account he exempts himſelf from any Subſidy or Aid to be given the Emperour, but he pleads a Releaſe of all Feifs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo <hi>ſub judice lis eſt.</hi> At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent there is no noiſe of any Preparations for that Expedition, the Court being in mourning for the death of the Dutcheſs Royal, the Mother of the preſent Duke.

               <p>The ordinary Temporal Revenue of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Dominions is 2.

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:47448:81"/>500. Horſemen, bearing their Charges during the War. This man was he that advanced his Houſe to that Honour wherein it continueth to this day in <hi>Florence.

               <p>This conſidered, the Papacy ſeems in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition to goe below it ſelf; the Pope one of the Prudenteſt that ever ſate in the Chair, all things compoſed, Money enough, but (<hi>hinc il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae Lachrymae</hi>) <hi>No Friends,</hi> or Backers.

               </head>
               <p>WHen we reflect on the State of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the frequent Seditions in it were a <hi>Wonder,</hi> conſidering the Settlement of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Reiglement (but for <hi>Spains</hi> 2. Over-ſights in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, alterations of Vice-Royes, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Subjects) and the preſent Peace, were a <hi>Miracle,</hi> conſidering the ſubtilty and reſtleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Inhabitants; but for <hi>Spains</hi> two poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Diverſions, the one more ſerious, an hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Devotion; the other more jocund, a daily Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy; they would revenge their being ſo <hi>poor,</hi> but that they are kept <hi>ſo,</hi> as well by their own <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> which is <hi>wiſely humored,</hi> as their Governours <hi>Impoſitions,</hi> which are <hi>neceſſarily exacted;</hi> beſides the two Securities for their Peaceableneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That the Commonalty thinketh all Employment above them, but the Plough: 2. That the Gentry
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:47448:99"/>judge all Buſineſs below them, but their Pleaſure; the firſt of which humours will keep them too low, and the ſecond too bare, to be troubleſome; to which I may add two more, 1. Their Perfidy and Treachery, that makes it impoſſible for them to truſt one another in a Deſign: 2. Their Rudeneſs &amp; Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, whereby they are capable of managing nothing but the great Horſe. Were not half the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Clergy Dependents on the King, <hi>Spain</hi> might be jealous of <hi>Rome;</hi> and did not half hold of the Pope, <hi>Rome</hi> might diſtruſt <hi>Spain;</hi> and becauſe they were wholly neithers, both might fear, did not <hi>that,</hi> in this laſt Age, ſet up for the Spiritual Monarchy of <hi>this,</hi> and <hi>this</hi> for the Temporal one of <hi>that.</hi> The Fate of <hi>Italy</hi> is it's only ſecurity againſt the <hi>French,</hi> and that of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> againſt the <hi>Turk;</hi> while this laſt had often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded it, as they did 1433. had it not been the Key of <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> and the firſt had often ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized it, as they intended under <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12th. but that is an Inlet into the Papacy: though the People would out at the <hi>Back-door,</hi> under the <hi>Saracen,</hi> as formerly, but that they chooſe <hi>ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> (as they call their duty) rather than barbariſm: And at the <hi>Fore-door,</hi> under the <hi>French,</hi> but that that is not an <hi>Eſcape,</hi> but a change of preſſures. The Emiſſaries of <hi>Richlieu</hi> and <hi>Mazarine</hi> had often embroyled this Place, had not thoſe more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, from the Pope, ſecured it. The Horſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on his Holineſs, keeping the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in the Saddle, and the Caution that the Church puts in at that Ceremony, that ſhe be not <hi>prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in her Right,</hi> is the beſt ground: Of the other,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:47448:100"/>the King of <hi>Spain</hi> puts, that he be not <hi>diſturbed in his Power,</hi> eſpecially ſince the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> could do the <hi>French</hi> againſt <hi>Arragon,</hi> as much right as <hi>Gon Salvo</hi> did <hi>Arragon</hi> againſt <hi>France,</hi> did not <hi>Millain</hi> beſtir it's ſelf, on the one hand; and had not the Pope diverted the <hi>French,</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Although the modern ambition of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan</hi> Noblemen, is more dangerous at this time, than the antient pretenſion of the <hi>French</hi> King (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit bottomed on the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi>'s Adoption, Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 7th's Confirmation, the laſt Will of the Duke of <hi>Main,</hi> and the Agreement between <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12th. and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> nothing obſtructing, but the Popes gift of it upon <hi>Spain</hi>) did not the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Preferment divide, and the <hi>Caſtilian</hi> Army of 6000.

               <p>THE Command of this puny State is of little Extent, the Soyl very unfruitful and ſteril, without any River, and the City ſituated among abrupt Hills, and many mighty Neighbours, and nevertheleſs this Republique, for ſome hundreds of Years, when as other greater Soveraignties of <hi>Senia, Boſnia, Hungary,</hi> &amp;c. were deſtroyed by the <hi>Turk,</hi> hath not only preſerved her ſelf, but advanced her Subjects in Wealth and Reputation. She commands in the <hi>Dalmatian</hi> Coaſt, from <hi>Cape Cumeno,</hi> to <hi>Caſtelnuovo,</hi> about 4. Miles into the Land; as alſo over theſe 4.

               <p>The City lying long-wayes, is yet no more than 2000. Paces in it's Circumference, and cannot be made greater, or enlarged, becauſe of one ſide it lyeth againſt a Rock, which commands it; and on the other againſt the Sea; And becauſe Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe and Peace have flouriſhed here ſo long, it is built very narrow, with high Houſes, and is full of Inhabitants; who being neceſſitated to ſpread themſelves among the adjacent Lands, when they have gotten Eſtates, fix at home. It is fortified with Walls, and quadrangular Towers, ramm'd and filled with Earth; but the impregnable Caſtle ſtanding upon the aforeſaid Rock, and encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in a manner with the Sea, commands both it, and the Haven.</p>
               <p>No man, but a Gentleman of <hi>Raguſa,</hi> hath any thing to do in the Government; and he that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with an under Degree, loſeth his Gentility; by which means there are now but 24. Families. All Gentlemen aged 20. are Members of the Great Council; and of theſe Gentry there were lately in number 317. In all their Councils, they vote by Ballot, and to any Offices and Dignities, 3. are firſt named, and out of them one choſen, as in <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</hi> The Rector of the Republique, with his 11. Counſellours, out of different Families, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in all the Colleges, there to vote with thoſe of the College. Theſe 12. were called the Little Council, for they aſſemble every day, to receive Petitions, Remonſtrances, Agents, Envoyes, or Letters, either from Strangers, or the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and do deliberate thereupon, but conclude nothing; In this manner they ſerve 12. Months,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:47448:101"/>and are then diſcharged, and are not eligible again for 2. Years, as is uſual in all the Colleges, except the Senate, and the <hi>Pregadi,</hi> who are alwayes continued. This Senate conſiſts of 48. and with the Little Council of 12. is made up to 60. who reſolve upon all which the Little Council propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. Thitty five of theſe is a <hi>Quorum,</hi> and may conclude by Major Voices; for among theſe 60. are alwayes 5. old men, of divers Families, who are to be preſent at ſuch Reſolutions; and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide <hi>Ne quod detrimenti capiat Reſpublica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are 4. Collectors, who receive the Intra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do or Revenue of the Publique, and pay, upon aſſignation of the Little Council, to the 2. under Receivers, that which they have occaſion for the ordinary Charge of the Publique, and that which remains overplus, is brought into the Treaſury, of which 5. antient honourable perſons (as they do the Money of the Orphans) keep the Keyes, and theſe men continue 5. Years in this ſervice.</p>
               <p>Their whole Revenue can hardly amount to 30000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling, which ariſeth chiefly out of the Impoſt on Wine, and out of this they pay the <hi>Turk</hi> for Protection 5000 <hi>l.</hi> and lay-out as much upon his Baſhaws, to have Friends at Court; for their great Negotiation in the <hi>Levant,</hi> makes them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to have buſineſs there; for this Money they are Toll and Cuſtom free, which is a matter of great advantage to them, and preferrs their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities before any others.</p>
               <p>The whole Force of this Common-wealth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Burgers, is a 100. <hi>Hungarians,</hi> who are a kind of Garriſon to the City, and ſerve the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:47448:102"/>to put Sentences in Execution. Theſe are commanded by City night Captains, 6. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are choſen every 2. Months, 3. of them ſhut the Gates by day, and guard them with Burgers, and ſome of theſe <hi>Hungarians,</hi> till midnight, then come the other 3. Captains, and relieve their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and in the Morning open the Gates; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſhutting whereof, according to the Roll, 2. Gentlemen, under 40. Years old, do daily guard, the one the Caſtle of St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> and the other the new Fort, and tarry there till they are relieved, by Perſons of the ſame quality, the next day; all other Officers and Captains, who ſerve the State abroad, either in War, or Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, are choſen by the great Senate, ſome for 7. others for 12.

               <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Raguſa</hi> are of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and have a Biſhop, but he muſt be a Stranger; Moreover they have 2. Churches, one for the Men, where the Preachers are hired by the year, by the State; and the other for the Women, where Preachers are hired for their lives; the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth not fearing the levity and ſedition of the Women, who are naturally modeſt, and keep al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes at home; but ſuſpecting the Men, who, by the conſtant inſinuations and inculcations of ſome peſtilent Doctrines, might be perverted. The charge of the Church Goods and Revenue is committed to three Eccleſiaſtiques. Thus have I given a more particular account of this little Spot, becauſe nothing was ever yet publiſhed, to give ſatisfaction, what it's Module was. As to it's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, the <hi>Turk</hi> governs it wholly, and it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable

It ſufficeth, that they do abundance of good Offices, in relieving of Chriſtans, in their Traffiquing in the <hi>Levant,</hi> and that's the beſt ſupply to be expected from them.</p>

                  <hi>GERMANY,</hi> AND The ſeveral Dominions, Principalities, and States thereof.</head>
               <p>WE are now to diſcourſe of a great, but he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneous Body, made up of divers Religions, divers Laws and Cuſtomes, and different Conſtitutions, under many Princes; for in the Declenſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, after
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:47448:103"/>the frequent Devaſtations of it by the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> when <hi>Charlemaign</hi> had ſetled his Conqueſt therein, he divided it among his Sons; and their Succeſſors likewiſe multiplyed it into more Diviſions: After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when the Empire came to be Elective, by the <hi>Aurca Bulla</hi> (and had leſſened the Popes pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory and abſolute Authority therein, who yet continues formalities of Confirmation, &amp; without which none can be called <hi>Augustus,</hi> the only barr to Proteſtant Princes, on whom he will never conferr it) and the Power thereof confirmed by <hi>Gregory</hi> the 5th, a <hi>German,</hi> to the three Electors Eccleſiaſtick, and 4. Temporal, all being within the Pale of the Empire; the Candidates, for that Dignity, to aſſure their Advancement, would bribe Voices with the Patrimony thereof, by which means, and their liberality to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, while it was in their power to do them good (as knowing their Authority was very tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient) together with the Covetouſneſs, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Huckſtery of ſome Emperours, who ſold the Imperial Lands for Money, little or nothing was left to maintain the Majeſty of the Place.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe ſquanderings made in <hi>Germany,</hi> a great deal more hath been limbed from it, which belonged to it, as it was the Repreſentative of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, under which name it ports it to this day; but it is but a meer ſhadow of that migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty State; for the Pope ſtript it of all it's Feathers in <hi>Italy</hi> through the frequent Broyles raiſed by Excommunication and Anathemaes againſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, who were willing to part with that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Dominion, which they could not keep,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:47448:103"/>without unſufferable Expence and Hazard of all; then the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Lorrain</hi> refuſed to own them, more than formally, and in Title, which were main Members of the Empire; as did alſo the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will be needleſs to inſiſt longer upon this Conſideration, having premiſed, that for 10. Deſcents together, the Dignity hath continued in the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Family, and three before that, the Founder of this Family being <hi>Rodulph,</hi> Earl of <hi>Habsburg,</hi> a Prince of a mean Eſtate, but great Spirit, who ſucceeded our Earl, <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi> after a vacancy of 12. Years, the Electors continuing it ſo long in vain, in hope of a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer like <hi>Richard,</hi> the greateſt Moneyed Man in <hi>Europe.</hi> The perpetuating of it in this Family ſo long, was effected by the policy of <hi>Charles</hi> the 5th. who cauſed his Brother <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to be Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Rex Romanorum</hi> in his life time, and ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſigned the Empire to him; which courſe hath been obſerved ever ſince, till the Reign of <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold Ignatius,</hi> the preſent Emperour, who was choſen after his Father's death, but his Brother <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was choſen before him in this manner. The College of theſe Electors was once a <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virate,</hi> but by the proſcription of <hi>Frederick</hi> Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> the Father of this preſent Prince, the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> was ſubſtituted in his Place; and upon the Reſtoration of this <hi>Charles Lodowick,</hi> an Expedient was found to make him the <hi>Octovir,</hi> but ſo, that he is the laſt of them all, by this means.

There are other great and free Princes, who have Voices in the Imperial Diets, and are Tributaries at will to the Emperour, ſuch are the Dukes of <hi>Brunſwick. Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenburg, Wittenburg, Lantgrave</hi> of <hi>Haſſia,</hi> &amp;c. ſeveral Biſhops, with ſecular Juriſdiction, as of <hi>Saltzburg,</hi> &amp;c. And laſtly, Free Cities, which are of two ſorts, not reckoning the Reſidences or Metropolis of free Princes, <hi>viz.</hi> Cities Imperial, in number 60. formerly 96. ſuch as have bought their Liberties of the Emperours, and pay a ſmall tribute yearly, and ⅔ <hi>ds.</hi> of all Aſſeſſements at the Diets to them, ſuch as <hi>Spiers, Wormes, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remburg, Stralburg,</hi> and many others; of all which more particularly in the Deſcription of the ſeveral Provinces.</p>
               <p>As to the Religion of this People, except under Eccleſiaſtical States, the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and the Hereditary Countries of the Emperour, it is altogether Reformed, but for the moſt part <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran;</hi> betwixt whom, and the <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> there is as great a Fend and Difference, as between the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and either of them.</p>
               <p>The Force of this whole Region of <hi>Germany,</hi> hath been computed to amount to 200000. Men,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:47448:104"/>and ſomewhat above half that number hath been often ſeen effect if in one body, in Expeditions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Turks;</hi> and if we conſider the multitude of Garriſons, and the many Armies on foot, in the late War, between <hi>Sweden,</hi> and this Empire, there can be thought to be few leſs of both ſides. The beſt Footmen are thoſe of <hi>Tiroll, Swevia,</hi> and <hi>Weſtphalia:</hi> the beſt Horſemen, thoſe of <hi>Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, Cleveland,</hi> and <hi>Franconia.</hi> Of Weapons, they handle the Sword and Harquebuze beſt. In the Field they are very ſtrong, as well to give the Charge, as to bear the Shock; where Order, which they duly obſerve, is of great effect, and it is as it were natural unto them, to keep a ſtately pace, and firm ſtanding. They are not accounted on for defence of Fortreſſes, or to hold Garriſons: and by reaſon of their corpulent bodies, they are not fit to ſtorm a Town, unleſs to fill the breaches: And therefore they are accounted rather reſolute and conſtant, than fierce and couragious; for they do not much affect that ſervice, wherein they ſee too much of hazard. After the Victory, they do kill all whom they meet, without difference of Age, Sex, or Calling. If the War be drawn out at length, or if they be cloſe beſieged, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently either mutiny, or give up the Town (but there alwayes excepting to general Rules.) In Camp they can endure no delayes, nor will they practice the Art of Temporizing: If their firſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize and Attempt falls not out to their mind, they will hardly be engaged again, or perſwaded to it by any means; and if they once begin to run, they will hardly turn their backs again, as was
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:47448:105"/>wofully manifeſt in the Battel of <hi>Kevesture,</hi> in 1596. betwixt <hi>Matthias</hi> the Arch-duke, and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan <hi>Mahomet.</hi> He that retains them, muſt be at extraordinary charge, and great trouble, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Baggages, and Wives, who follow the Camp, and conſume abundance of Proviſion, and without that they ſtand in no ſtead. Their Horſes are rather ſtrong than couragious, of ten of which, eight are uſually preſt from the Plough, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them of ſmall ſervice; and beſides, they quail when they ſee their blood.</p>
               <p>The Revenue of the Empire, which comes to the Emperour, is ſo little worth, that it is ſcarce worth mentioning; for, beſides the Tribute paid by the free Cities, which is but 15000. Guilders yearly, 1500 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling, there is little elſe that can be reckoned as a Revenue; It had need there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of ſome Prince, whoſe own Eſtate can ſupport the Grandeur of the Dignity; which hath been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other reaſon, why the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> hath held it ſo long: as alſo, for that it is the only Rampire againſt the formidable Power of the <hi>Turks.</hi> And his Authority is as little as his Revenue, for he hath no Negative Voice, but is as it were the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Officer, to execute the Decrees of the Diets: whereas the Princes, and free Cities, are abſolutely Soveraign; and can, in their Aſſembly General, Depoſe him, if they ſee cauſe.</p>

               <p>The Count of <hi>Oldenburg</hi> is of a farr antienter ſtanding, and of a Princely Deſcendency, and is Maſter of as fine, and larger a Country, by ſome Provinces bequeathed to him by the Counteſs of <hi>Jevere;</hi> infinitely ſtored with Oxen, Sheep, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and with Veniſon alſo, which run in large and fair Woods, the pleaſant Game of the Gentry of this County.

               <p>Adjoyning to this Country are the three Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oral Arch-biſhopricks,<note place="margin">4.

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:47448:108"/>for that the Empire was made Elective, and they ſet their price often upon the Market; Beſides, there hath happened a diſſolution of many great Eſtates, out of which they have carved to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what they liked, with the Connivence of the Empire, and under the ſpecious pretence of <hi>Dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dands,</hi> and Bequeſts to the Church.</p>
               <p>The Intereſt of theſe Electors, is to defend the Papal, Imperial, and their own Authority, of which they are equally jealous, from the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Notwithſtanding the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Triers</hi> took part, or was a ſecret friend to <hi>France,</hi> in the late <hi>Swediſh</hi> War, which made the <hi>French</hi> ſo hot upon the reſcue of his Country, and ſo reſolute in the freeing of it: But in caſe of danger to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, no queſtion is to be made, but they will unanimouſly concurr againſt it; and with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they draw all the Eccleſiaſtical States of <hi>Germany:</hi> And are prone enough to aſſiſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour againſt the <hi>Turk.</hi>

               <p>The next Principality or Dutchy we ſhall treat of is <hi>Lorrain,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">5.

It is bounded and circumſcribed between the lower <hi>Palatinate, Alſats, Triers,</hi> the Dutchy of <hi>Bar, Burgundy,</hi> and <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> all of them fine Provinces; nor is <hi>Lorrain</hi> inferiour to the moſt of them, were it not for ſome dark and thick Forreſts, which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſe
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:47448:108"/>the Country. There were in it formerly ſome Imperial Towns, as <hi>Metz, Verdun,</hi> and <hi>Thoul;</hi> but <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d. of <hi>France,</hi> reduced them under his obedience, and erected a Parliament there, to make it a perpetual Province of <hi>France,</hi> as it hath ſince proved: Of late it hath loſt ſome Ducal Towns (and Provinces, as the whole Dutchy of <hi>Bar,</hi> taken from him by <hi>Lewis</hi> the 13th. and County of <hi>Clermont</hi>) viz. <hi>Moyenvic, Stenay, Dun,</hi> and <hi>Jametz;</hi> theſe three laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing formerly to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to him by this Treaty; and the Provoſt-ſhip of <hi>Merville;</hi> Beſides, the Duke is at all times to give paſſage to the <hi>French</hi> Forces into <hi>Germany,</hi> and to renounce all Leagues, Alliances, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences with any forein States or Princes, to the prejudice of that Kingdom; withall, he was bound up to an acquieſcence in whatſoever had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by judicial proceeding, gift, or diſpoſal of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> untill the date of the Treaty, by which theſe Conditions were alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to be ratified by the Emperour: This was a bad bargain, but more could not be obtained; ſo that the ſaid Duke, feeing himſelf thus expoſed to the Armes of the <hi>French</hi> King, and any ſudden ſurprize, upon pretence of paſſage, beſides many other Retrenchments of his Soveraignty, did offer, by a Treaty, to ſurrender the ſame wholly into the hands of the King, upon Condition, his Family to be admitted, as Princes of the Blood, and to the ſucceſſion of the Crown, after thoſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> with ſome Proviſion of Money and Penſion, for the ſupport of his Dignity and Family; and this
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:47448:109"/>was highly talked of, and near a Concluſion, but it is not yet confirmed and accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>As to his Intereſt, we may gueſs how narrow it is; and how he is pent up, as to any Concern of his in <hi>Europe,</hi> by that comprehenſive Clauſe, That he ſhall not hold Intelligence with any Prince, to the prejudice of <hi>France;</hi> which will be conſtrued ſo, if he ſend but a Complement to any of them. The <hi>French</hi> King hath had a longing envious eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Country, as diſ-joyning his Conqueſts from his other Countries, and therefore he lives here but precariouſly, and as a Tenant at will. As to the <hi>Turks,</hi> he concludes, there are no ſuch Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, as the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters of State, who laid all wayes to entrap him, and finally forced him to take Armes againſt <hi>France,</hi> as a deſperate remedy.

In this Province is ſeated <hi>Newburg,</hi> the Title of the ſecond Branch of the Houſe <hi>Palatine,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Cleve,</hi> in ſhare with the Marqueſs of <hi>Brandenburg.</hi> Here is alſo the City of <hi>Noremberg,</hi> famous for its rate workmanſhips, a fine and beautiful Town, yet no River near it, but the curious Induſtry of the People ſupplyes that defect. The Country ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near as bigg as the Lower, but nothing ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and fruitful, being chiefly mountainous and barren, except in Mines of Iron, and ſome of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, one of which is very conſiderable: So that it is a great retrenchment and diſmembring of the <hi>Palatine</hi> Patrimony; but what cannot be cur'd, muſt be endur'd: And ſo we paſs to <hi>Bavaria.</hi>

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:47448:112"/>diſtinct Juriſdiction of it's ſelf. The Country ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally overſpread with Woods, and cold, and barren; but the Lower ſomewhat more fruitful, and abundantly more pleaſant. In the Higher is ſeated <hi>Munchen,</hi> famous for it's ſeizure by the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who found infinite Treaſure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and for that it is the Reſidence of the Dukes of <hi>Bavaria:</hi> In the Lower <hi>Ingolſtadt,</hi> farr more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, for that it put the firſt affront upon the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and made him give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſiege thereof. 2. <hi>Regensburg,</hi> or <hi>Ratiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone,</hi> famous for the Diets held there, being a moſt beautiful and pleaſant Fabrick; and <hi>Paſſaw,</hi> as eminent in former times, for divers Conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons held there by the Princes, and for the notable Diet made there, by <hi>Charles</hi> the 5th. in favour of the Proteſtants. As to the Diſtrict of <hi>Saltzburg,</hi> it is a barrener Country than the Higher <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and conſiderable for nothing more, than that their Biſhop challengeth the precedency of all other Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticks, except the three Electors. It borders upon <hi>Auſtria,</hi> which ſhall limit this Diſcourſe of <hi>Germany,</hi> becauſe we will conſider the Hereditary Provinces together, when we come to <hi>Hungary,</hi> and the Actions and Deſignes there, as more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for that place, though with ſome diſorderly revulſion of this great Body.</p>
               <p>The Intereſt of the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, he being look'd upon as one of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteſt and richeſt Princes in <hi>Germany,</hi> or indeed in <hi>Europe;</hi> for he was paid in both hands for his ſervice in <hi>Germany;</hi> and Duke <hi>Maximilian</hi> was elſe very much afore-hand with the World, as his
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:47448:113"/>Loans to the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the 2d. ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently manifeſted. The preſent Duke is a moſt zealous violent Catholick, as was his Father, and therefore ſure to the Emperour, as well as by his Alliance, being born or this Emperour's great Aunt, married young to old gouty <hi>Maximilian,</hi> who, by ſome prolifick Cordials, got for him by the Jeſuites, had Iſſue by her, but the preſent Duke, and his Brother, are of weak Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Jeſuites have alſo alwayes had a mighty influence upon this Court, ſo that no doubt is to be made of the Duke's forwardneſs in the War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> to which the Duke offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon condition he ſhould be made General; notwithſtanding he will, and hath advanced alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſome very conſiderable Supplyes, by way of Loan; and as to his Proportions rated upon him, they will be ready with the formoſt, and are likeſt to do the beſt ſervice, for that they are accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Fruits and Wines of that Country, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving none of their own, any being Neighbours to that. By this Electors Voice, the Papacy hath five Votes againſt three, in any Matter; and in the Vacancy of the Empire, a pretenſion, and forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exerciſe of the <hi>Vicuriat,</hi> which belonged to the <hi>Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> not as Elector, but as Count of that Circle, as he alleges, and ſo did not forfeit that right. And it is concluded alſo, that if the preſent Emperour dyes without aged Iſſue, the Imperial Dignity will be given to the <hi>Bavarian,</hi> who is the only Catholick Prince (not reckoning the Arch-dukes of <hi>Tirol</hi> and <hi>Inspruck,</hi> as nothing conſiderable without the Patrimony of <hi>Austria,</hi>

               <p>The Revenue of this Prince is computed at 400000 <hi>l.</hi> double to that of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing partly out of his Silver Mines, which yield 140000 <hi>l.</hi> of the Money; and next, out of his Salt, made at <hi>Hall,</hi> and the Exciſe of Beer, which amounts to great ſumms; Beſides, he levies a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Tax for Proviſion, and maintenance of a War againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> although in the moſt ſereneſt
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:47448:120"/>times: With this Revenue he keepeth a ſplendid Court, at his Reſidence of <hi>Dreſden,</hi> and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth a noble Magazine, out of which, in a dayes time, he can furniſh out Armes for above 30000.

               <p>By which it appears, that this Prince is the moſt Conſiderable in <hi>Germany,</hi> as well as by that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and diſadvantage he did the <hi>Swedes,</hi> firſt by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering, and then relinquiſhing them, by a Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality with the Emperour.

               <p>He is obliged to do ſomething extraordinary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> for that Taxes ſake, which he hath received for ſo many Years together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any occaſion of disburſement; yet his Subjects do not much care for that War in perſon, and would wiſh the Money beſtowed in hiring of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries, for they march heavy, and laden with Weapons, and Bottles, and a Baggage behind, without which a <hi>Saxon</hi> is no-body in the Field: So we paſs to <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and <hi>Lunenburg.</hi>

               <p>Its Second is Trade, and the Dominion of the Sea; and it's not unknown, what Expert Captains are truſted, what Multitudes of Seamen are bred up, what Proviſions are made for Fiſhing, what Laws are in force for the Vending of Fiſh, what Correſpondence is kept with the Northern Coaſts for Cordage, how many and ſtrong Veſſels are built; what Stores and Magazines, even beyond what ever was known, are ſet up; how bleſſed a Prince, who makes it his buſineſs to underſtand and manage the Sea Affairs; how Royal an Admiral, the King's only Brother; what Noble Officers, all

If to the Officers of State, they are honourable and experienced. If to the Cabals, there was never Prince, or Council, ſince the Conſtitution of Empires, a ſafer Preſerver of ſecrets; and yet none, whoſe ſecrecy and ſilence we leſs may fear; where the chief Prelates caſt Reverence, and the chief Nobility, of both Kingdoms, Dignity; and all knowing in Forein Affairs abroad, and Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtique Conſtitutions at home.

If other Princes throw away their People with vain and ambitious Attempts, we are onely employed <hi>to</hi> ſecure our own Borders, <hi>to</hi> promote our own Intereſts and Honour.
